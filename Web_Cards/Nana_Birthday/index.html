        <h2>Dear Nana,</h2>
        <p>Today you'll be receiving this <i>digital</i> card from me!
          I made this webpage myself, and it's currently a part of my website.
          I hope that you're able to see it properly!
          While both you and I are stuck inside on our birthdays this year, I'm sure you'll find lots of very nice things to do.
          Maybe a nice walk, a new movie to watch and a special dinner?
          I hope you make today special. I'll talk to, and see you, very soon!
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <p class="pRight">
          I send this web-card to you with much love. Yours truly,
          <h3 class="pRight">-Owen</h3>
