      <h2>Here's a digital card, because I enjoy making these</h2>

      <p>I hope that things clear up over here in Qu√©bec, and we get a chance to see each other real soon</p>
      <p>~~~</p>
      <p style="color: #3f7759;">Mid-October must be a really nice time for a birthday. Things are getting chilly, but it's not unbearable yet. I hope that a walk or something else nice is in store for you today. Sending you lots of love.</p>
