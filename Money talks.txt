-Spike in costs
-Unable to pay CART lab fees
-OPUS issues


-Recently checked my account inquiry to see if there were any outstanding charges
-Noticed that I owed $900.41 for Undergrad tuition and fees, but I had thought that I had already payed all my necessary fees
-After checking, it appears that my Fall tuition cost had increased by about $600 or so, and my Summer costs by about $9000 or so
-Was just wondering where these increased charges were coming from
-Of note, after I had previously payed what I though was the end of my tuition for the first year, I removed an overflow of about $8900 that I had via refund

-When trying to pay my CART lab and student fees, I was unsuccessful and the transaction kept failing
-Could it be that I missed a deadline for payment?

-Finally, I've been having some issues ordering my OPUS card from the student centre, and I was thinking it might be an address setup issue
