      <b><u>Note 1: <q>Writing the History of the Internet</q> (A timeline)</u></b>
      <ol>
        <li>The head of the ARPA computer research office Bon Taylor has a problem linking various computers and operating systems</li>
        <li>With some other scientists, he creates IMPs (tinier computers to link the original computers), and around 1967 helps to secure the ARPANET contract with BBN</li>
        <li>Originally, the ARPANET was used for military and graduate study work</li>
        <li>Around 1964 however, the idea for a decentralized network came from the Rand Military Cold War corporation</li>
        <li>Funding for the ARPANET continues coming from the military in a Cold War era, and so the research and funding for decentralized networks is continued</li>
        <li>This leads to more computerization my osmosis in society</li>
        <li>From this rise in computerization, things such as Usenet and Unix systems become popular for open-source computer “hackers”</li>
        <li>In 1969, BBN creates a “Network Working Group” to create protocols and have requests for Internet standards in the form of RFCs (Requests for Comment)</li>
        <li>Many “Netizens” of the Usenet felt excluded from the important ARPANET, and were well aware of the big government’s “iron curtain” separating it from the Usenet</li>
        <li>In 1972, BBN engineer Ray Tomlinson creates the first e-mail service for the Usenet</li>
        <li>Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, radio and electronic users as well as “computer liberationists” come together to create the basis of the Usenet as a democratic and open platform</li>
        <li>The first personal computers are made around this time</li>
        <li>Most of the discussions still focused on technical matters, but smaller communities in the Usenet and groups like “MsgGroup” start becoming popular</li>
        <li>In the mid to late 1970s, the various networks start turning themselves towards capitalism and corporation use. Programming starts to be seen as a paid service instead of the previous open uses of it on the Usenet</li>
        <li>In the early 1980s, many corporations start creating their own networks for private use, but would all combine later into what we call the Internet</li>
        <li>Near the end of the report, we see the rise of corporations such as Microsoft, Intel, and many chatroom services, but also instances of open-source companies and services such as Linux, Apache, and Perl</li>
      </ol>
