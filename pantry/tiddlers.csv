"!CatcheKäPlay!","A newly-founded company based out of [[🌱 Druxe]] that sells access tokens to its ""[[Sparce|⚫ The Sparce]]-wide cache game"". Its caches are hidden in many public places on [[Bhava]] and [[Soetanto]] [[🌍 planes]]. Each cache leads to the next (with a monetary price each time of course), eventually leading back to [[🌱 Druxe]].

The inter-planar event has been widely criticized for its manipulative tendencies, and is currently under investigation by a [[Planar Convoke|The Planar Convoke]] tribunal. Furthermore, the developers of the game are known to have been in collaboration with [[The Sodality of Miasma]] prior to their involvement.

## **Primary lifeforms:** Kromacvin

---

The labyrinthine and cathedralic halls of the cities of Krom are vast and majestic. Cultivated and mastered over thousands of years of work, they stands in stark comparison with the rest of the plane. Outside of its city walls, the world stretches on infinitely in every direction, covered in a blanket of dust and low lifeless hills. All vegetation and native life (save for the [[Kromacvin]]) appears to have withered and died long, long ago.

---

*Howling winds scatter and pick up dust as they rush along the flat stone ground of the wastes. Flat horizon meets flat sky as far as the eye can see, save for a few solitary clusters of columns rising into air along the landscape. Without a proper atmosphere above, the myriad of stars seem to stare down upon you.*","20230502223344935","20211226163027450","#ffffff","[[🌍 planes]] Zopilote","text/x-markdown"

A gaseous spherical orb, floating aimlessly in [[🌌 The Flow]]. While some speculate that the plane does in fact have a solid central core, the theory has never been proven. The Cities, towns, and paths of the world all float in the air, held aloft by strong gusts of hot air. Thousands of temples, shrines, and graves hang in its atmosphere, and a continual reverence hangs about the plane.

---

*A thin, perpetual ringing sound wafts in from all around. Clouds of all shapes and sizes float above and below, and one can see small clusters of houses and shrines popping up through the vapours.

An oddity of planes, Balx is a confluence of four [[planar|🌍 planes]] discs, each in constant war with the other.

Each demi-plane's society is organized according to a [[Format|The Balx Formats]]; a cultural tradition and godly legacy. No one knows the original reason for the constant conflict, but few have investigated long enough to deduce it. The plane is nearly entirely closed off, its [[pestle|🚪 pestles]] long unattended.","20230502223419076","20211226163156066","#ffffff","[[🌍 planes]] Atolondrar","text/x-markdown"

"⚫ The Sparce","The (seemingly) empty void between the 9 planes of [[🌐 The Pantry]]. Home to abyssal monsters, [[🪨 Remora]] production, and smuggler [[🚀 starships]]. An impossibly unregulated and uncontrollable space, breached only by planar ex-patriots, criminals, military, and dark secrets. Through it all meanders [[🌌 The Flow]], the innate and possibly arcane pathways of magic and happenstance.

The Sparce has no air for planar beings to breathe, and this can only be traversed by starship, or with [[portable magic air|Flowstones]] source. Most starships have air sources on board.

*Players' note: In the event you begin to suffocate in The Sparce, the PHB suffocation rules apply:*

*“A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + it’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). When a creature runs out of breath, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying.”*

It is accessible only by its [[pestle|🚪 pestles]] or by accident. Many strange disappearances are often attributed to someone having ""stepped into Yadri"".

A spinning top of a world, Yeima geography is dotted with stony crags, vast fields, and deep caves. The temperature is unnaturally warm, though not for the Emotion [[Demons]] that live there. The plane is disc-shaped, with one large and exponentially tall spire at its centre. All roads on the world lead to the spire.

---

*Squat clusters of cities dot the rim of disc, between which high-speed trains flow.

Due to their natural importance, these currents also became important to non-natural factors (one way or another):

All planes are connected to [[The Mortar]] by [[🚪 pestles]], but each in different ways, and by different amounts. The only other way to access them is with [[🚀 starships]], though this can at times prove quite difficult and even dangerous.

Generally speaking, the 8 major planes are encircled around The Mortar in clusters of two in the following clockwise order: Druxe and Aaliat, Reht and Yeima, Krom and Fomrh, Balx and Yadri. Each pair is a member of one of the [[🗺️ provinces]].

"🎭 aspects","## **Mortal aspects**

As well as gods, mortals of all [[🧑 races]] also contain aspects, though they're much more hidden, and more psychological. At times, these aspects can be drawn out from a being by a powerful (usually godly) force. Respectively, they represent the entity's mind, body, and soul.

### **Lustrous (mind)**

A radiant, regal aspect revealed when communing with gods or receiving godly boons. Almost gratuitous in its fanciness and impressiveness.

### **Somber (body)**

A sunken, dark aspect revealed when in places between life and death or when in times of unbelievable cruelty. Muted and sickly, but not without its own decoration.

### **Unavailing (soul)**
The most common aspect, embodied by mortals at any other time. Religious debate attempts to define more base interpretations of the aspect, such as states of self-mummification, nakedness, or hairlessness. Most are fringe beliefs, and are concentrated to scholars on [[⏳ Krom]] or [[☁️ Fomrh]].

---

## **Godly aspects**

[[😇 gods]] of all orders have different forms, which they demonstrate at different times based on certain conditions:
- Current worshipper(s)
- Location of manifestation
- Ceremony of some sort
- Godly ""age""

Similarly to [[⚖️ Balx]] or [[The Mortar]], Aaliat is not one world, but is instead collection of small demi-planes. Each disc-shaped plane sits stacked on top of the last, and each has its own atmosphere, local stars, and edges. Shifting slightly at all times over top of each other, each demi-plane corresponds to a particular environment conducive biological life. There are 5 demi-planes in total, each with their own sub-ecosystems and populations.

From top to bottom, the demi-planes are ordered as such: [[Nerra]] > [[Eutsa]]  > [[Espoc]] > [[Æo]] > [[Laiag]]","20230502223919769","20211226163000442","#ffffff","[[🌍 planes]] Bhava","text/x-markdown"
"🐟 Sparce wildlife","Though vast and seemingly uninhabitable, [[⚫ The Sparce]] has thousands of indigenous species, most of which are nomadic, and spend their lives migrating along [[🌌 The Flow]]. Botanists are unsure whether Sparce animals evolved from [[planar|🌍 planes]] lifeforms, vice versa, or a mix of the two, but many similarities can be struck among wildlife from both domains. Animals native to The Sparce often bear some identifying features:

- Bioluminescence (and/or bioluminescent protrusions)
- [[Flow|🌌 The Flow]]-breathing gills or lungs
- Telepathic movement & species communication

## **Fish**
The most common animal sight in the Sparce, clustering near to [[🚀 starships]] as they fly. From small schools of minnows to gigantic whales. All bear distinctive bioluminescent protrusions.

## **Birds**
Rarer than fish, but not entirely uncommon. Most of these species do not possess legs, and instead 'fly' indefinitely through the void their entire lives. The most unrecognizable when compared to their planar cousins.

## **Mammals**
Sticking closest to planar orbits, Sparce mammals are primarily small, herbivorous, filter feeders. Bred for utilitarian purposes, diversity among this genus is heavily lacking, with only a few species dominating the top 80% of their entire population.","20230504172944726","20220508235828971","#fa9600","[[⚫ The Sparce]] [[🌌 The Flow]] [[❗ featured articles]]","text/x-markdown"

Unknown to almost all of the public, save for a few devoted [[Sainthood]] officials and well-respected biologists.

## **Proto-Celestials**
Large masses of spinning wheels, wings, and eyes. While echoes of these features can be found in modern [[Celestials]], they are particularly accentuated here. Visual contact often leads to aneurysms and other neurological trauma.

## **Proto-Demons**
Tall and winged, with dark fleshy skin and small piercing eyes. Large masses or horns of various sizes crowd their heads. While inherently shy and animalistic, they do possess strong emotional intelligence, and respond in kind to the feeling of those around them.

## **Proto-Florafolk**
Large, interconnected root consciousnesses that are localized between many individuals and proteins. Though barely conscious, they possess pheremone-level control over their local environments and the beings within them. Often misclassified as infections, overgrowths, or birth defects.

## **Proto-Giants**
Ancient, nearly unthinking landscapes, ranging from mountains, to oceans, to forests. Similar to Proto-Primordials in their unseen intellect, but far less opinionated. Often conflated with [[godly influence|😇 gods]] or ecological phenomena.

## **Proto-Humanoids**
Extremely tall bipedal figures with elongated arms and legs, and a distinct lack of visage. They are curious, easily distracted, but also extremely vulnerable to physical assault. They contain within their bodies abstract pieces of cultural memory, art, and culture.

## **Proto-Kromacvin**
Extremely varied in form, with unfettered access to all [[Kromacvin]] evolutionary patterns. However, their inability to control this feature and their animalistic intelligence leaves them extremely dangerous to both themselves and others.

## **Proto-Primordials**
Largely inanimate, paradoxically-appearing structures, concentrated along [[Flow|🌌 The Flow]] leylines. Based upon places of worship and energy, they tend to display traits of unseen intelligence and genuine will upon those that come in contact with them.

"🪨 Remora","Natural substance which gathers on the outsides of [[🚀 starships]] which have spent large amounts of time in [[🌌 The Flow]] currents in [[⚫ The Sparce]]. An opalescent, crystalline formation which hardens in shapes that evoke the subconscious thoughts of nearby sentient entities.

Often harvested for its mind-altering properties, it is harmless in small doses, but can be potentially dangerous when taken in large quantities. It is scraped off hulls of ships, boiled down to remove impurities, then cooled into crystals of various sizes. Most commonly ingested by being eaten, but can also be snorted or injected (to less effect). It is non-addictive, quasi-legal, and very misunderstood.

Regular Remora users develop a glossy, iridescent sheen that covers their fingernails, toenails, and some patches of skin. It is harmless, and slightly scaly to the touch.

Beyond its ingestion purposes, it is also used as a clean (but non-renewable) fuel for starships, repurposed for jewelery, and studied for scientific purposes.

Gods have a very strong presence throughout [[🌐 The Pantry]]. Many lineages that descend from them, and their demi-god grandchildren still roam and rule.Though multitudinous and with many varied myths, the gods are still fundamentally other, alien. Gods have many forms and are worshipped in many different ways, by many different peoples. Whether this is an actual representation of the god itself duplicating, or an effect of culture, none know.

Though the [[Voquev]] are the primary deities of reverence, many minor [[Yyenwid]] are also worshipped, though in more specialized and less-public fashions. Even more so, the [[Oleald]] are made up by the many powerful grandchildren upon grandchildren of the Yyenwid.

The [[Claster]] are nearly forgotten to time. Whispers of ancient planar deities float through silent tombs and well-stocked libraries.

They are powered by the wills of their [[Helmsperson]]s, who use raw intellect to move the large vessels though the void.

"A soul-spinning conversation","***[[Date: -pc8,329,794|Passage Consideration]]***

One low sullen evening, only but 206 ages since the last Claster had become dust, [[Voquev Zephyriah]] and [[Voquev Tieraal]] were walking along the shores of time, as they were oft to do. The two were quite used to each others' company, as they spend many evenings together, in contemplation. Among other deeds. They had become acquainted purely on a formal basis, but quickly grew close, which confounded many of their peers (especially [[Voquev Gol'iead]], who thought themselves to be much closer to the god of The Wind than many others). No matter the muttering and the whispering of the other [[Following Gods|Voquev]], Zephyriah and Tieraal still took many such marches as they swapped stories and prose.

This time however, Zephyriah had arrived bearing a proposition which they had been chewing on, both morally and literally. The concept was posed thus:

""Imagine a sweet smell. Let it waft from you"" said Zephyriah.

""It is done"", said Tieraal, who chose their words carefully when speaking.

""What does it remind you of?"" asked Zephyriah.

""Deep and low shuddering, and a catalyst of new sprouts"" proclaimed Tieraal.

""Ah yes, I can smell it too. Though it reminds me more of a hitching gust of blown sand.""

""Your words are spun well, my kin.""

""Perhaps. Though perhaps I am spun from them.""

""Perhaps.""

30 days passed between the gods' last and next footfall, and in this time, Tieraal had formulated a proper response. They asked: ""If you are spun from your words, then what I am spun from?"" At this particular moment, Zephyriah was in the process of commanding 6,432 air elementals in a great and terrible siege against the fortress walls of [[Claster Veyeimall]]'s rotting corpse, in which hordes of [[Demons]] had begun to take root. It was for this reason that they were only slightly preoccupied, and gave an unthinking answer.

""You are spun from silence. It is for this reason that we are so well acquainted.""

""I am spun from what I choose to be spun from. Silence is just the most comfortable"" said Tieraal, reluctantly.

""Not for me,"" said Zephyriah. The siege had ended, and they had quieted their kingly aspects.

""Perhaps you are correct then. I'm fortunate to know one so differently spun.""

""As am I.""

The two deities continued walking in silence, before parting ways at a 9th-dimensional dive-bar, and never thought of the conversation again. A passing scribe however, had fervently recorded the entire conversation in scripture, and immediately began distributing it en masse. Over the next 40 or so years, this short poem about soul-spinning would form the basis for 6 major world religions, before falling out of popularity and renown. It would still be another 9,000 uncountable ages before the death of The Following Gods, and the birth of [[The Falling Gods|Yyenwid]].","20230605013858185","20220512011130334","","[[📜 myths and stories]] [[⚫ The Sparce]] [[🔒 private]] [[The Shore]] [[The Awakening of the Gods]]","text/x-markdown"

"Aetivima Period","***[[Start date: pc1 (length: 2,300 years)|Passage Consideration]]***

A long stretch of unparalleled chaos and lack of regulation in [[🌐 The Pantry]] that occurred eons ago.

Initially, the birth of the [[Oleald]] and the [[Descendant Beings|🧑 races]] was celebrated. Foretold by [[Claster Kromaeg]] and [[Voquev Opeqte]], the [[😇 gods]] saw their grandchildren grow beyond measure. Their happenstantial existence was proliferated to all places in [[🌐 The Pantry]] and on the [[🌍 planes]].

This optimism was short-lived however. In time, vocal minority voices of those seeking [[war|Yyenwid Truge]] and [[annihilation|Voquev Yinsenvanyr]] began to sway masses of the mortal peoples. Democracy, mutual aid, and compassion were silenced in the breaths of the majority of the other mortals. For many thousands of years, this period of regression saw the gods turn from the physical world.

It took many hundreds of revolutions, culture wars, and honest love (see the [[Taqadum Period]]) to champion the original ideals of the god majority, and is the reason today that such democratic values are so strongly protected in The Pantry today.

All Celestials sport pastel-tinted skin and a possibility of having extra mouths, arms, heads, etc. The most complex of their order resemble clusters of spinning wheels, centaur-like bodies, or even more symbolic forms. All are blind, and most don't even have eyes. Though peaceful and thoughtful, they are entirely neutral in disposition, seeing other beings' lives as somewhat inconsequential. They fancy themselves scholars and monks, but of course, many exceptions exist.

Celestials are 'born' through magical rites and specific rituals performed by other Celestials. In groups of 2-4 (or sometimes even 1), new Celestials can be created. Celestials do have the ability to procreate sexually, though not with their own kind. Any resulting children will retain traits from both parents.

"Chemical warfare on Yadri","***[[Date: pc893|Passage Consideration]]***

In the beginning of the [[Aetivima Period]], when inter-[[planar|🌍 planes]] warfare had yet to become ""civilized"", many great atrocities were played out. They were brought on by mad and hungry [[😇 gods]], revelling in newfound destructive purposes.

One such massacre was the experimentation of bio-chemical warfare and weaponry, designed by [[Yyenwid Ompos]]. Targeted blight magic was hurled upon the surface of [[⛰️ Yadri]], killing nearly 70% of its mortal population. The massacre was so deadly that for the following 547 years, its mention was forcefully expunged from all record and memory.

Many of the great craters where the chemicals fell still mark the plane's surface, most of which were naturalized and turned into lakes by the surviving [[Giant|Giants]] populations around the year pc1,440.

Constructs are rare, but growing steadily in numbers. There in furious debate (both within their race and out) as to whether they possess souls, but the matter ultimately has no consequence.

Most constructs operate using a conjunction of both magical and technological means. Arcane power governs their logic and intelligence, but Turing-esque tape machines power their movement, strength, and agility.

Constructs, while popularized for industry use in the late [[Aetivima Period]], were actually in use in various prototype stages by military ventures as early as [[~pc850|Passage Consideration]].

Constructs typically live as long as their parts will allow them to.

"Demons","Perhaps the one of the most controversial [[🧑 races]] in the whole of [[🌐 The Pantry]], Demons are at once tactful diplomats and raging warlords. Their plethora of subraces mirror a range of seven emotions (Love, Joy, Curiosity, Apathy, Jealousy, Fear, Anger). Demon societies are rigidly structured into hierarchies, with the ""good"" emotions always on top. While popular misconception attributes negativity to the lower castes of Demons, most are incredibly individualistic, and rely only mildly on their emotional designation. Demons are born Green coloured, but change through Yellow, Orange, Red, Purple, and finally Blue during their lifetimes.

Demons possess a strange magic quality which allows them to perceive strong emotions related to their particular subrace in individuals, but only if they have formed a ""pact"" with said person. Through innate racial magic, they must perform any request imposed upon them though such a pact (enacted only willingly), and in exchange have access to the other's emotions as discussed above.

If a Demon makes enough pacts (usually an extremely high number) with a particular being, they begin to lose their sense of self, and even corporeal form. In time, and with more pacts, their very mind and essence may take up residence inside the other's body and brain, fully immersed in emotion and thought. This ""possession"", while rare, can be extremely devastating, for both the demon and their host.

Demons typically live between 100-120 years.

## **Timeline/scenes**

### **Returning from death**

For [[Brahmiel (Brahm)]]: Flat stone area, sounds of water to the left, and wind to the right. Surrounded by endless rocks of varying size. All rocks shift, twitch, and ripple when walked near to. After a few steps, one doesn't stop shaking. If approached and picked up, it crumbles into dust, which invades his sinuses and the dream ends.

For [[Mule]]: Deep underwater in a stormy reef. Many other bodies are intertwined in the kelp. Struggling to the surface, they see a thin strip of land and a distant mountain on the horizon. Before anything can be done, a large wave crashes over them and the dream ends.

For [[Penellaphe (Pen) Astaseul]]: Sharp shale ridge, with a flat valley down below, and a sea far below it. Climbing the shale and awkward passages, she makes it towards a shining and vibrating source at the top. Upon grasping it, its light blasts all that can be seen, and the dream ends.

### **Each character starts in different locations on a [[Commonwealth|The Sparcian Commonwealth]] ship after being [[re-materialized|Flow Re-materialization]]**

All awaken with small circular tattoos around the base of their necks. This is a by-product of the re-materialization.

1. In the medbay, surrounded by bodies
   - All on cots
   - Doctors don't notice at first, and are unarmed
2. In the hold, tucked away between boxes
   - Inside a flimsy box, must break to exit
   - Various weapons, medicines, archives, and [[🪨 Remora]]
   - Sedated and sleeping [[Giant|Giants]] tucked away in the very back. Covered in a tarp and well hidden
   - Sounds of footfalls up above
3. In a detached escape pod
   - Coming out of a stasis tube
   - Glass is cracked, but holding
   - First aid kit (open), rations, emergency manuals, etc. lying around

### **They each have to survive for a little while in separate ways**

1. Attended to by doctors upon awakening, and asked to help with a critical patient
   - Given stimulants and water
   - Other patient (Vhenjel, Human) starts to convulse, and a vein must be found to inject serum (Medicine DC 10 to stabilize)
2. Very small (and easy) combat encounter in an empty corridor. 2 [[Regiment 7]] boarding soldiers (Cultist, p. 345)
   - Just coming out of a room after searching it
   - Will give chase if ran from
3. [[Flowstone|Flowstones]] hidden in the cabin (Investigation DC 7 to find). Must float back to the main ship or activate an emergency beacon
   - With the Flowstone, they can kick off and bounce along through the debris towards a hole in the hull
   - If they activate a beacon, the ship's engineer shoots out a grappling hook to pull them in

### **Eventually, the cavalry arrives. They are separately brought brought to the breach**

1. Escorted by doctors
   - They were told to bring any that survived to the bridge
   - They're still very nervous, and keep a distance (dangerous procedure)
2. Meet up with Commonweath soldiers
   - [[Barracuda]] and [[Cuttlefish]] ships fly by
   - Explosions far out in space
   - Door at the end of the corridor opens, and [[Dure]] and soldier come through
3. Float or towed to the [[Engine room]] by the ship's Engineer
   - Back of ship is blown off, exposed to [[⚫ The Sparce]]
   - Must deploy the emergency shield (INT DC 12 to activate)
   - Comms are down, so they have to go to the bridge to report the change

### **They are commended for their effort by Captain [[Bran Hegan]]**

I understand that this is probably a strange experience for you all. Know that this was not the way I wanted to meet. But I'm so glad you were able to make it. You probably have many questions.

I'm not sure if you were aware, but you were dead. Quite handily so. No trace, as far as we could tell. Pretty much vaporized... Probably best to just say it: [[Re-materialization|Flow Re-materialization]] is a finnicky science. We brought you back from nothing. Our Chemists were able to synthesize minute particles of your coming through [[🌌 The Flow]]. Through arcane and circuit, you've got a second chance.

As you're probably aware, we're not in the most stable of situations. Conflict racks us. This was the work of The Convoke. They're not so friendly off world, and they definitely don't want us shipping aid to mining colonies.

I know this is probably all a lot to handle right now, but, I have one more matter. I'd love to help get you on your way, back to picking up your lives, but I'm stretched thin as it is. I'm willing to offer you all a ship, but it comes with a job. An official one. It's not combat, I wouldn't put you to that. we have a small fleet of information gathering, purely non-political. You'd be in our employ, but free to choose which tasks you take.

### **They head off in the direction of their first mission**

- Mission: Bring critical supplies to a nearby outpost that they recently lost contact with. They were going to check it out themselves, but had been ambushed
- Given a crew: Engineers to fill out the ranks. They had also been dead, but were re-materialized shortly before the battle
- Given a [[ship|The Crystal Ship]]: Most of their ships were out fighting, or were being repaired. However, they had this experimental model in the hangar that they were willing to spare
- Ship tour
   - Bridge with [[Median helm]]
   - Grappling interface
   - Common area & private rooms
   - Engine room
   - Medbay
   - Kitchen
- Ship personality is met with and customized
   - Must be set up through the helm first
   - Given a name and other identity elements
   - Encourages others to try the helm as well

Captain Hegan allows you to stay aboard his ship for as long as you want, to recuperate and get a feel for your new environment. In time, you all settle into your various nooks and crannies, and get ready for your first voyage aboard The Crystal Ship. (Anything they want to do before leaving). When the time comes, the support structs and scaffolding holding the ship in place are removed, the Orca's bay doors are opened, and your ship slowly begins to lift. It edges out of the doors, and hangs for a moment freely suspended in [[⚫ The Sparce]], before slowly picking up speed. You glide out and away from the main ship arcing around to head a course. With your reforged hearts, a destination charted, and minds on the future, you head out into the unknown.

- Captain's log, expressing concern about senior members' tactical choices:

> ""Despite orders from above, I can't help but worry. In fifteen years, I've never been this close in. I can feel the presence of the planes, pushing on me. The crew can feel it too, I know. Those damn CWs have gone too far, colluding with the Convoke. No wonder the Founders cut ties. Yet still, such rashness, and so near Reht. It's worrying.""

   - Requires an engineering expert to decode (found either on-plane, or at a significant [[The Sparcian Commonwealth]] or [[The Planar Convoke]] location)
   - *Once decoded, it reveals a network of attack routes, safehouses, and outposts*

### **Landing on the Soetanto trading outpost / delivering goods / outpost market**
> [[The Soetanto Trading Outpost]] begins to come into view as you get within 10-15 fathoms or so. The operation itself is built into and around a large temple, itself situated large and sprawling on an asteroid (~1/10th the size of The Moon). As you get closer, small patches of encampments and minor towns can be seen along its surface, the largest of which is your destination. [[The Crystal Ship]] enters the atmosphere, and you make your way toward the town's large landing pad, which is in fact located in a wide courtyard at the centre of a temple. A massive array of communications spires, atmosphere producers, and metallic holy symbols are clustered in makeshift towers all over the temple's roof. The temple itself is made of pale grey and while stone, and is extremely simple in design (though quite spread out).

- Arrival at loading bay
   - Fully-packed landing strip
   - Mostly [[⚓ freight]] and [[🪝 harvest]] vessels
   - A few other, smaller ports cluster around the main terminal, where they land
- Conversation with [[Cardamom]]
   - Introduces herself
   - Inquires about how small the shipment is, but thanks them nonetheless, saying that these outposts need to be held strong under [[The Sparcian Commonwealth]]
   - Provides info about the trade outpost
      - Age of the temple (since before the oputpost)
      - Strategic location (connected to all major routes and [[Flow|🌌 The Flow]] lines in [[Soetanto]] and [[Bhava]] provinces)
      - The temple provides universal [[chit|💰 chits]] compensation for all local residents, and acts as storage and distribution for the province's [[Commonwealth|The Sparcian Commonwealth]] branch
      - Notes that they are welcome to explore the surrounding market while the goods are being processed.
   - Offers ship services
      - Magical blessing (5 CHT): Advantage on next navigation check through difficult space
      - Tune ups (10 CHT): Full repair of starship
- Checking goods
   - If obviously tampered:
      - [[Cardamom]] speaks with the party
      - She chastises them a bit, noting the importance of trust among servants of the cause
      - She lets them off the hook, but mentions that she'll let [[Bran Hegan]] know, and that the price will be reduced by 1/3
   - If not tampered:
      - She thanks them for their service
      - Pays them in full
   - If secretly tampered (DC 17 to notice):
      - She makes no mention of the tampering
      - Secretly contacts [[Bran Hegan]]
- Sends a spy to tail the party while they're off the temple grounds

> You exit the landing pad ear in the direction that [[Cardamom]] directs you. Passing through a short stone hallway, you come out on the exterior of the temple. Immediately you are struck with the business of the market. The landing pad was busy, but here, shops, caravans, and pedestrians clog the narrow streets and alleyways.

> The market extends out in all directions; a criss-crossing maze of covered streets. Beams of light stream down through holes in the tarps and thin fabric that hang over the jumble of bodies. You see mostly Humanoids, being so close to [[💀 Reht]], but as [[The Soetanto Trading Outpost]] is such a hub, there are folks from all around here, and goods from far and wide.

      - Will only spark up if chaos is breaks out
      - 2 Fires killed immediately, other encircled by the Earths
      - Eventually broken up by [[Commonwealth|The Sparcian Commonwealth]] soldiers from the temple

### **Ancient [[Claster Eprehtt]] temple/ruins**
- After some time, the party returns to the landing pad or is found by an assistant
   - The assistant leads them towards the records room, when they suddenly become separated

> You all turn a corner, and suddenly, the assistant is gone. There are no hallways leading off, and the current one just extends straight out in front of you.

- All hear a large clacking/slamming sound coming from far down the hallway
   - The follow it down, making group Perception checks (DCs 12 and 18)
   - Successful checks reveal more info about how to escape
   - Both successful checks mean an exit can be found
- The sound is louder closer to exits (only they can hear it)

> As you follow the sound, taking rights and lefts as best you can, it grows fainter and fainter. barely indistinguishable to even [[Brahmiel (Brahm)]]'s acute ears.

- If any of the previous perception checks were over 14, the details on the walls can be noticed

> All the while, you've been able to notice more details appearing in the walls. Ornate columns and thin, decorative lines span down the walls. Tiny decals of prostrate and thin figures clutter the spaces near and on the ground.

### **Fight and reward**
- Tomb of self-mummified worshipers
   - Statue in the centre
   - Mummified figures all around

> Making as best a guess you can as to the source of the sound, now reduced to barely a whisper of a click/crunch, you round another corner. Immediately, you turn into a vast cavernous space. A couple stories tall, this seems to be an internal atrium of sorts. Very few beams of light spill in from the spotlight above, illuminating tiles on the stone floor.

> At the centre of the room sits an enormous stone statue of a hunched figure. Nearly as tall as a double decker bus, the stone carving is cloaked, its face hidden from view, legs crossed, and palms resting folded. At the feet of the statue sits a large stone box of sorts, which seems to be built into the ground. All around the base of the figure and the box are carved small intricate runes in tight concentric patterns.

- Rune translations (Higher Speech aka Deep Speech)
> ""And Eprehtt said unto the beings of flesh: Ye Shalt Tumble From The Vantage Of Life, And Be Embraced By Death! And the flesh mourned their passing with reverence and solemnity. The Exhalted Claster found such ceremony to be amusing, and thus a new school of mortality was formed.""

> As your gazes rest at the statue's feet, a shocking scene jumps out. Three figures sit in its shadow; a [[Human|Humanoids]], a [[Celestial|Celestials]] (rotted smooth face, hole in chest), and a [[Cayman Zoofolk|Zoofolk]]. They are withered, heavily bandaged, and beautifully adorned with dusty necklaces and headdresses. They all sit facing the statue, with heads bowed.

- Touching one of the mummies or opening the box triggers the fight
- Mildly useless magic items in the box
   - Monocle of thick quartz to see 'hotspots' of death
   - 1d4 use, limited potency, life-giving wand (thin, petrified wood)
   - Arm band that stops signs of life from appearing to others (breathing, pulse, twitching, etc.) (delicate earthy colour-stained fabric) (i.e. reveals Somber [[🎭 aspects]])
- Fight begins
   - **Show map**
   - **Stat blocks:** Mummy (p. 228)
      - Half health (36), split between all 3 (12 each)
      - Half damage (1d6 + 3 bludgeoning and 1d4 necrotic)
   - Moths flit from corpse to corpse and animate them
      - Striking an un-animated mummy brings it to life
   - Ending a turn on any of the patches of light teleports the creature (monster or player) to another patch
   - Cool, fresh air immediately begins to flow in after it the mummy is defeated

[img[images/maps/soetanto_temple_hidden.png]]

### **Back to the ship**
- Any other needs
   - Market activities
   - Condition of the vessel

### **Next jobs**

> We've heard tell of a few [[Commonwealth|The Sparcian Commonwealth]] ships disappearing off the coast of [[⏳ Krom]]. Vanishing into thin air. No wreck and no crew left to speak of. I can understand the apprehension at taking such a job, but you'll be payed hazard wages, and we'll hopefully be able to put this mystery behind us.
- **Pay: 200 CHT**
- On-ship episode, which eventually crash lands on a randomly-appearing demi-plane
- Turns into a beach/castaway episode
- Hidden arcane anchor under the water draws ships in
- Mystery as to who/what constructed it

> We've recently struck a deal with [[The Remora Guild]] for the exchange of research equipment. We need a crew to quietly deliver an atomic [[🪨 Remora]] clock between our [[Sparce|⚫ The Sparce]] research lab and [[🌱 Druxe]]. The device itself is valuable and experimental, so this needs to be kept under wraps.
- **Pay: 125 CHT**
- Ultrasonic vibrations of clock draws in space animals, which eat the ship
- Must be escaped/destroyed from within
- Small civilization trapped in its stomach

> Asteroid mining near the outer ring of [[The Mortar]] appears to have caused quite a stir among the local biologists and miners alike. Apparently there's a been a gold rush of rare plant materials coming out of the rocks, or so we're told. Everyone on this side of [[⚫ The Sparce]] is rushing in to get in on the action, so it'll be a competitive job. I even hear that the local [[Convoke|The Planar Convoke]] administration is running the event as a competition.
- **Pay: 50% of what you're able to collect**
- Multiple-round competition, with resource-gathering mechanics
- Backstabbing and fast-paced action

   - Inside they found 3 sleeping forms
- [[Brahmiel (Brahm)]] awoke [[The Linker]] with Lesser restoration
   - She was terrified and confused, and quickly was taken back by the tendril
- They made their way towards the cluster, pushing the other ship along with them

### **Part B**

## **Job description**

> We've heard tell of a few Commonwealth ships disappearing off the coast of [[⏳ Krom]]. Vanishing into thin air. No wreck and no crew left to speak of. I can understand the apprehension at taking such a job, but you'll be payed hazard wages, and we'll hopefully be able to put this mystery behind us.

**Pay: 200 CHT**

---

## **Session goals**

- Elements of puzzle-solving
- Start exploring some character backstories
- Subversion of expectations, then further subversion
- Actual starship combat
- Final ethical choice(?)

---

## **Timeline/scenes**

### **Traveling (1st day)**

- Highest Perception roll wakes up
   - [[Twis]] is tripping out late at night
   - They have opened the [[🪨 Remora]] rations, and have had a fair sized dose
   - They accidentally knocked over a broom in the [[Engine room]]
   - [[Reffiq]] is sleeping in the far corner, and Twis says that they find him here sometimes, sleeping next to the humming machinery
   - They offer some Remora, and will continue conversation
   - They remark on how much each group doesn't know about the other
- After having their conversation and heading out, they stumble upon [[Beets]]

### **Encounter with [[DIL]] (2nd day)**

- He signals to the ship (comes through garbled in the static)
- His [[Sparce|⚫ The Sparce]] cows block the way, brushing up against the ship
- He comes by riding on a large one
   - The herd (10 adults, 3 calves) are pulling a large clay [[starship|🚀 starships]]
   - Gestures to be let in
- The cows drag the clay ship onto the hold
   - After [[DIL]] says its okay, the door on it opens
   - A small group of [[Crumblekin]] exit (4 adults, 8 children)
   - 10 more stay hidden in the ship
   - He says he's ferrying them to a nearby asteroid which he says they say is their home
   - They are harmless, and offer each party member a small clay doll
      - This will later grow into a fully-fledged [[Crumblekin]] in 1 week
- Says that he likes to check in on newcomers to the area, and that the cows need a grazing break (they lick off the Remora on the outside of the ship)
- He asks why they're heading this way, having not seen their ship before
   - Will point them in the right direction
   - He's heard some scattered communications off towards a nearby dwarf star
- Offers them some Sparce cow milk before leaving
   - Says that it cures all ailments, but he doesn't touch the stuff himself
- If I need to fill for more time, an [[encounter|Random Sparce encounters]] happens

### **Combat encounter / mounting tension**

> Following the directions that DIL gave you, you cautiously head out towards the nearby dwarf star. General ship audio chatter and distant station pings recede away, and your communications instruments grow silent. Up ahead, for those that can see it, the star looms every larger. By most standards, it's actually quite small, only about the size of an average planet, but its brilliant pale blue light still shines piercingly.

> After 10, 20, 30 minutes of approach, a small ping appears on the radar. Growing ever closer, it appears in fact to be a strange cluster of ship signals. So close they must be sitting right on top of each other. The cluster appears to be bound within the star's orbit, listing slowly far out in a lazy arc. It's now that a second ping sounds. The helm pipes up:

- Helm's description
   - Swordfish class
   - Headed right for us
   - It's sending pings out towards us, attempting to analyse us
      - Strange pings, in some sort of repeating pattern
         - -. / . / - / -.- / - / -..-
         - *(201519)*
   - I can try and analyse it back, but it might need some time (will take 1 minute)
   - Can you keep it distracted?
- Combat begins
   - [[Swordfish]] class
      - Speed: 50 fph or 300 ft/round
      - 250 HP
      - 18 AC
      - 14 PP
   - If they lose, they get absorbed

> A final blast rocks the ship. The lights flicker, sputter, then go out, before being replace by the amber glow of the backup lighting. The helm goes silent; the ship is dead in the water, stalled from the barrage. The gravity magic has apparently been disabled too, and you all begin to float in place. You can all hear the rumble of the Swordfish ship's engines as it passes overhead, its weapons now suddenly silent. Your ship lurches, and you can hear the grinding of metal. Pen, you suddenly see something wriggling into view on either side of your head around the helm. At the same time, down in the combat terminal, Mule you see small glowing ethereal tendrils begin to creep out from behind the keyboards that surround you. *Same for wherever Brahm and Beets are.*

> The tendrils begin to unfurl faster now, reaching out for you through the air. Suddenly, they seem to leap, curling around and attaching themselves to the backs of your heads.

- DC 16 CON save (group check)

> The feeling is immediate. A great wash of exhaustion comes over you, and you vision blurs. In the back of your mind, the sound of static grows and grows. So loud it gets that it eclipses all thought. You fall unconscious, floating aimlessly in zero gravity.

- Highest CON save failure gets to see the ship being towed towards the cluster (if all fail)
   - Successful checks are unaffected
- If they win, they can explore the ships
   - [[The Compiler]], [[The Assembler]], and [[The Linker]] are all safe in the defence ship

### **Exploring other ships**

> Peering out of the windshield, you can new get a better look at the strange cluster of ships before you. It's a dense tangle of starships of all kinds, from combat to passenger, all floating haphazardly together. They're connected by wires, cables, and anchors, as well as the eerie pale blue arcane tendrils. You see ships from the Commonwealth and Convoke alike, and many more who's insignias and colours you don't even recognize. As you float closer and the ships twirl in the void, the centre of this cluster is revealed. A large, interlocking metal knot sits nestled in the middle of it all. The object appears to be constantly shifting, its gears and geometric sides rotating and grinding against each other. From it extend all the glowing tendrils which connect to the ships.

- If they won, they can visit any number of the ships
- If not, the defence ship has connected them up to the cluster
   - Roll 1d6, 1d4, 1d2, etc. to determine which ship comes connected next
   - Every 1-2 ships, there's other options to explore
- Defence ship
   - [[Swordfish]]
   - [[The Compiler]], [[The Assembler]], and [[The Linker]] are together inside, in a sealed chamber
   - Used to be mercenaries
   - Old model, from ~20 years ago
- [[The Planar Convoke]] ship
   - [[Lamprey]]
   - Embedded in a Commonwealth ship
      - [[Angler]]
      - All crew is dead
   - One person in the cockpit
   - From ~5 years ago
- [[The Sparcian Commonwealth]] fleet
   - [[Cuttlefish]] and a few [[Mantis]]
   - All gathered together
   - From ~6 months ago
- [[Regiment 7]] ship
   - [[Squid]]
   - Shining plates cover it
   - Crew of 5
   - From ~ 5 years ago
- Giant cruiseliner
   - [[Angelfish]]
   - 40-50 passengers
   - Travelling from [[💀 Reht]] to [[☁️ Fomrh]] on a religious excursion
   - From ~10 years ago
- The occasional [[🪝 harvest]] or [[⚓ freight]] ship
- The kernel
   - Large bulb-shaped device
   - Humming with some sort of machinery
   - Metal tubes and arms wrap around it, constantly twisting
   - Docking port of the front
   - [[Aspect of Om'nd]] physical form resides inside
   - Very old and cryptic machinery, age > 200 years
   - Raises and lowers gravity periodically more and more as they get closer to it through the ships

### **Entering the Kernel**

- Inaccessible from connected ships
   - Only entrance is from outside
- Docking port for ships, but also manually accessible
- Thumping comes from within, if unable to calm the Aspect after the internal battle
- Requires access code
   - *(201519)*
   - Can be accessed by brute force
   - DC 18 INT check to correlate all instances of code to this lock

> **If opening:** You hear a loud thunk noise, then a hydraulic hissing noise as the door unhinges. It's incredibly thick, and requires effort to pull open.

> **If destroying:** Your blast compacts the door, tearing the machinery all around it. In the weightless environment, it floats back towards you off of its hinges. It appears to have been quite thick.

- If opening the kernel, and not having been absorbed yet, light spills out and tendril unfold lazily
   - Strong and immediate absorption
   - No clear visuals inside, save for the memory of a turning hooded face
- Otherwise, it seems to be sleeping

> The inside of the machine is incredibly small. Almost half the diameter of the external spherical shell, and the interior is lined with wires and lights. Floating, quietly and serenely among the electrical equipment is a small creature. No larger than a cat, it hangs suspended, its limbs curled in on itself. *See [[Aspect of Om'nd]] description, but smaller, almost juvenile.*

- If taken out, the simulation flickers, and begins operating at a low capacity
   - Will completely dissolve after 1-2 hours, and the inhabitants will awaken

### **The Waiting Room (skippable if needed, save for visions)**

- Lowest previous CON save wakes up first
   - Others are seated in chairs beside

> You open your eyes to bright light. You can hear the faint tinkling of chimes, as if blowing in the wind. You're sitting in small room with adobe pastel walls and a door on each side. In the room are a various assortment of chairs and potted plants which sit on the floor. At one end of the room is a large reception desk. Behind it sits a figure, not unlike the form in which the helm first presented itself to you. Two more figures sit in chairs across from you. Up on the side of the wall ahead of you is a mechanical device showing a row of numbers (201516).

- Doors are shut and inoperable
- Receptionist
   - Seems to be writing something behind the desk, but upon observation, there is no paper or pen
   - Stops writing when they stop talking
   - ""Welcome to the waiting room, please have a seat. You will be with us shortly.""
   - Gestures towards the mechanical device
- Waiting 1
   - Appears to be reading a book, but holds nothing in their hands
   - ""Ah, you must be the new arrivals. We'll be there soon!""
- Waiting 2
   - Tapping their foot and twiddling their thumbs
   - ""Have you been waiting long? They'll call you in time.""
- DC 14 Perception check to tell that the environment is cracking
- After some time, it becomes much more apparent
   - Glowing fractures crackle along the walls
   - Bits of the ceiling begin to crumble and fall
   - After some time, the floor falls out

> The mechanical device above whirrs to life, and the rightmost number turns with a clicking sound from 6 to 9. *(201519)* Suddenly, the floor shifts, crunches, and splits open below you. You begin to fall. *Opportunity for player action.* You tumble, spiralling into the bright void. Below you, a hole is growing larger, like a great maw ripping in space. Your fall slows, jerkingly, until you're flowing downwards as if almost in a stream or current. At last, you merely glide through the hole, passing from the white void to a vast landscape of grass and rolling hills. Your feet gently touch the ground, and the hole above you snaps shut with a vacuum sound, and you are left alone to the sound of swishing grass. Above you, moody clouds wander along the sky for as far as can be seen. Behind you lies a calm but brooding sea, lined by a thin strip of ever-stretching beach.

- If they break out early:
   - Small flits of light can be seen spiralling around them as they fall
   - Some get quite close, flying through legs and around heads
   - If grabbed, the character receives a random vision of the memory of The [[Aspect of Om'nd]] (DC 8 Acrobatics check)
   - Also, temporary 2 hour +2 boost to WIS and CHA
- If they fall through after waiting:
   - Same thing as above, but the lights are harder to catch (DC 16 Acrobatics check)
   - Lights are further away, moving much faster
   - Scatter when the floor breaks away

- Visions:
   1. A council of entities, all sitting comfortably on pillows made of galaxy clusters. They are slit down the middle, half of which are screaming and cursing the other half.
   2. Two hands wrapped around a still and sullen face. The eyes blink. Warmth flows from the hands, into the face, and it gasps, sentience filling its eyes.
   3. The player character sees themself, standing alone in a void. The view approaches, morphing itself and its sentiments. Thousands of calculations flit through its mind, and hidden arcane tendrils latch viciously into the character.

### **Big reveal / false denouement**

- If they get out early:
   - They appear a few metres behind [[The Compiler]], [[The Assembler]], and [[The Linker]]
   - All 3 have their backs turned, and they're muttering amongst themselves
   - They are trying to find out where they went, and are manipulating the interspace
- If they wait it out:
   - They appear in an empty field
   - [[The Compiler]], [[The Assembler]], and [[The Linker]] approach them (lustrous descriptions first)

> **Brahm:** Glowing sigils and runes float aimlessly about your head, twisting and reforming. Behind you radiate faint translucent arms that trail after your 4 arms as they move. Your robes seem to blow in a magical breeze that affects only you, and golden horned pauldrons sit upon your shoulders.

> **Mule:** Your chitinous hide, once green and dull, is now coated in a golden sheen, and gleams in the light. A thin pointed crown floats above your head between your antenna. Your speedo is now accompanied by matching red bell bottoms and drooping sleeves. You leave golden footprints behind you, which fade quickly.

> **Pen:** Mimicking your golden jewellery, many chains, hoops, and dangly earrings now adorn your horns, head, and fingers. Two thin, slowly-spinning discs encircle your horns, and similar discs sit around your wrists and ankles. Your uniform glimmers with countless sigils, now seemingly embroidered into the fabric.

> **Beets:** Faint golden outlines of your head float on either side of your face, faint enough to be unnoticed. In patches along your fur, the ends of the hairs are faintly tipped in gold, giving a fawn-like dappling pattern here and there. Glowing pollen seems to radiate up and out of your body when you sit still.

- **[[Reffiq]]:** Large ethereal gowns flow from him, almost weightless in the air. Large decorative spikes pierce his skin, in his ears, arms, face, and chest.
- **[[Twis]]:** Decorative clouds shift and rumble around their head and shoulders. Their elbows and knees sport decorative cuffs, and small golden mouth tattoos appear all over their body.

- They seem familiar and comfortable to them, but do take some time to get used to
- The trio greets them, with [[The Compiler]] at the head
   - She welcomes them, acknowledging their confusion
   - She's happy to have them here, but apologies for the mode of arrival
- All 3 introduce themselves
   - [[The Assembler]] hopes that they like their lustrous [[🎭 aspects]]
   - [[The Linker]] mentions that it took a lot of effort to connect their strange ship up
- Compiler leads them towards [[The Helm Interspace]]
   - It materializes before their eyes, similar to how helms do
   - Entities begin to walk around them
   - The buzz of connection flows through the air, like small burst of lightning, flashing, and reforming

> What now stands before you is a finely crafted arrangement of halls, towers, stacked buildings, and pointy spires. Resembling a large open square, this campus-sized area is dotted with towers, and individuals rove all over. Though the large courtyard in which you stand is the centre of the space, one large round tower in particular stands above all else. Lighthouse-shaped in design, it emits a thin blue beam, which passes slowly over the surrounding grass fields.

- [[The Compiler]] explains that they are in [[The Helm Interspace]]
   - A digital-arcane space akin to a helm cockpit
   - They were able to connect up multiple helm spaces and support multi-entity instantiation
   - The three of them care for the visuals, entities, and connection of the helms
- She explains that the interspace exists with thanks to their lord, and his great vision
   - All power flows from him
   - All is made better in his domain
- Though they work hard for the good of the community, none were born here
   - All were brought here by the roving ship outside
   - It is corrupt entity, a defence protocol of the lord's, gone erratic
- The ship outside, and internal 'fractures' have been getting worse as the cluster slowly drifts into the star's inner orbit
   - They fear that they may be irreversibly close in another half year or so

> It should be noted that all here are free to leave, though most find this place to be welcoming, homely, and frankly, better than life through the void. Here, we see factions cohabitate in harmony, when once they would war. Here, we see the end of disease, the end of politics, the end of pain.

- [[The Assembler]] pipes up: on that note, our lord would like to speak with you
   - Afterwords, we would be happy to see you to the exit
- Various people greet them along the way
   - They can be seen reading, talking, running, etc.
- As they approach the tower, the light from the top which shines down, passes over them, and they feel its static for a moment

### **Meeting with The [[Aspect of Om'nd]]**

- The 3 lead the party up the tower
   - Circular staircase
   - Static gets slightly louder as they approach
   - Where before, the walls and atmosphere had this intangible artificial quality to it, everything seems to much clearer now
- [[The Compiler]] explains that the 3 found themselves stranded in this world, many years ago, their bodies washing up upon its shores
   - There to greet them was their lord
   - He showed them the future that they could grasp, and shape to their wills
   - He gave them purpose in a fractured world
- She cautions them to address him as ""my lord"", and warns that they may feel some discomfort at first
- They reach the top, coming up into a small room

> In the middle of the room, seated upon blankets and fine rugs, is a large beast. Its body, lion-like in physique, has six legs (the front pair of which are human arms and hands), and blue/green fur. Furled neatly on its sides are two massive fleshy wings, devoid entirely of feathers. Its head, wreathed in a large unkept mane, rises up a little higher than it probably should on its neck, in an almost humanoid way. Where its face should be, there is nothing. A gaping black hole like a mask stares out towards you, turning to face you as you ascend the final steps. No smell comes from this creature, but a slight static sound fills the air, growing in volume when its ""gaze"" passes over each of you in turn. Seated on either side of the lord are two entities, similar to those featureless ones you met in the waiting room.

- The three guides step forward, and face you, and speak one at a time:

> **The Compiler:** You stand now in the presence of the Lord of Fabrication. Progenitor of our shared interspace, and author of our true peace.

> **The Assembler:** Known by many names: That Which Bends; Odenmos, Reality Consumer; Following Child of Voquev Vivanyr; Aspect of Simulacra.

> **The Linker:** Yyenwid Om'nd, God of the Helm.

- Through the haze of their words, each hear a singular, piercing voice ring out in their minds

> **Brahm:** What warmth do you seek, spiralling through the cosmos? I can give you sanctuary again, here with the masses.

> **Mule:** What unity do you seek, scurrying through the dust? I can give you true purpose here, drone among many.

> **Pen:** What salvation do you seek, toiling in obscurity? I can give you redemption, here in the eyes of all.

> **Beets:** What penance do you seek, trodding empty roads? I can give you one worthy of worship, here at pilgrims' end.

- [[Aspect of Om'nd]] speaks through the mouths of his attendants
   - He welcomes them to his helm interspace
   - He hopes that they are pleased by his artificial splendor
- Explains most of the history of [[The Helm Interspace]] if asked
   - The Kernel
   - The first inhabitants
   - His goals
   - The looming star
   - He has been iterating on his interspace with a total of 201 inhabitants, in different versions for 519 years
   - *(201519)*
- He knows that they have duties which pull them elsewhere
   - But offers that they stay for a few days
   - Time passes much faster in here, and not but an hour will have passed... out there

### **If they decide to leave the [[helm|🧢 ship helms]] interspace**

- The [[Aspect of Om'nd]] ushers them forward
   - He asks them to relax, wrapping his front arms around them
   - If they relax and peer into the void of his face, they find themselves tumbling into darkness
- The others see the one departing filter away like falling sand, similar to what happens when someone exits a helm simulation

> Once again, you find yourselves tumbling, this time through darkness instead of light. Below you, you can feel your body. You senses slowly return to you, and you can feel your physical form floating weightless in zero-gravity.

> The closer you get however, the more the environment shudders around you. Shockwaves of air pass you by as you fall, and cracks form around you in the darkness. You can still feel your forms below you, stirring to consciousness, but you can also see through the cracks now, out towards the campus you just left.

- They hear shouts
   - The campus appears to be ""on fire""
   - Ripples in the reality flare up like flame
- People can be seen fleeing
- The lighthouse has gone out

> **If they stay:** The void shatters around you into a tiny fragments of dark glass. You land, hard this time, on sand. Once again, you find yourselves on the shores of [[The Helm Interspace]], facing off towards the endless water.

> **If they leave:** You concentrate on what is real, and your body returns to you. Your fingers twitch as your mind tumbles through the darkness. Suddenly, the two slam together and you jolt awake.

- **If entering from the kernel:** Wake up cradling the [[Aspect of Om'nd]]'s form

- She ship is still stalled
- Tethered to the other ships by cabling
- Out the window, the kernel can be seen sparking
   - The entire cluster is drifting faster towards the star
   - Tendrils lash out wildly

### **If they stay in the [[helm|🧢 ship helms]] interspace (skippable if needed)**

- [[The Compiler]], [[The Assembler]], and [[The Linker]] lead them back down the steps, to rooms where they can stay
   - Curiously evocative of their rooms on the ship

> From there, time seems to pass in a haze. The constructed environment is warm, comfortable, adaptable. It draws you in, not maliciously, but benevolently. Time indeed does pass quickly. Every three hours here brings a new sunset and sunrise, and the flow of other interspace individuals presses around you. *Opportunity for player action.*

> Over the next few days, you are invited as newcomers to participate in various activities. From lectures given by [[The Assembler]] on the beach, to finely-crafted artificial meals, to fire-side story sharing, you are enveloped in the group. It's welcoming, but leaves you incomplete. At times you feel your physical bodies twitch, and are reminded of the artificial nature of the space. It's nice, but it's not your home. And all the while, the tower's beam combs the land, like some enormous useless lighthouse.

- Locations
   - Main tower
   - Central courtyard
   - Dormitories
   - Vast plains
   - Infinite sea
- Activities
   - Sharing stories with other individuals
   - Eating
   - Religious ceremonies on the beach
   - Learning to shape the environment
- One night, they are sitting around a courtyard campfire
   - All sharing stories from the outside
   - 8-10 people
- The tower's beam suddenly slows
   - Sputters and goes out
   - A shockwaves rumbles down the tower
- When the shockwave hits the ground, ""fire"" erupts, ripping holes in the environment
   - Figures can start to be seen flitting between houses
   - At first they look like they're fleeing, but then they realize that they're unnatural

### **Saving the day**

> Approaching the campus, you see many people fleeing the base of the tower. Worshippers in flowing gowns, and even a few of the blank entities you had seen previously. The environment shakes, and the tower begins to shudder. [[The Compiler]] falls to her knees, squeezing her eyes shut. The tower calms. She breathes deep, and stands up. ""We need to get up there, now."" She points to the top of the tower.

> The large open space at the base of the tower is surprisingly empty. You make for the staircase, leading up to the spire when another quake rumbles down it. The lights around you dampen, flicker, and return, their now muted colours casting strange fractal shadows along the ground. Suddenly, you can feel eyes on you. Entities drawn out of the cracks between the simulation, ushered down the tower. They creep now, into the light. Lumbering and twitching. Humanoid in shape, but with hunched backs and distended arms. Their forms flicker, as if trying to find physical form in the space.

- Combat
   - 3x Nothic (pg. 236) *(-1 Nothic if time is tight)*
   - [[The Compiler]], [[The Assembler]], and [[The Linker]]
- After the battle, many more seem to be materializing and forming at the base
- The Linker runs for the base of the spiralling staircase
   - Tower is 120 ft tall (in terms of movement speed and spellcasting)
   - She is too fast for the others, and if not asked or made to stop, she will run all the way up and be ambushed at the top
   - At the top awaits 1x Ettercap (p.g 131), who has grappled The Linker
   - She is suffocating, and will be dead in 3 rounds
- [[Aspect of Om'nd]] lies curled in the corner, shuddering and occasionally blasting beams of light from his face
   - Calmed with DC 16 Religion check (-1 DC for each of the 3 guides)
- If calmed, the shuddering stops, and the cracks re-form
- If not calmed, all entities are slammed back into their bodies *(see above for description)*

### **Denouement**

- [[Aspect of Om'nd]] is harmed, but not dead
   - No entities around for him to speak
- [[The Compiler]] asks for their location not to be revealed
   - Says that they will repair and resume as best as possible
- Asks if they're sure they don't want to stay?
   - Their help could be valuable
- To leave, they look through the Aspect's face *(noted above)*

### **Getting [[Beets]] to [[⏳ Krom]] (loose collection of optional scenes)**

- [[Reffiq]] apologizes for his brashness, as prompted by [[Twis]]

### **Next jobs**

> There's an upcoming peace talk happening on [[⚖️ Balx]], facilitated by some diplomats from [[The Sparcian Commonwealth]] and [[The Remora Guild]]. I know it's not the most interesting of jobs, but we need a capable crew to ferry them there from [[The Mortar]].

- **Pay: 100 CHT**
- Picking up some [[The Sparcian Commonwealth]] (negotiator) and [[The Remora Guild]] (translator) diplomats for an infrastructure talk
- They accidentally bring an alien monster on-board
- Chaos ensues

> Now, we don't often like to send our scientific divisions into warzones, but we have an urgent matter at hand. Fighting has broken out off the coast of [[⛰️ Yadri]] of all places. Some of our transport ships were attacked by [[Convoke|The Planar Convoke]] forces. Normally, we'd be able to deal with this, but our ships were carrying works of [[⚖️ Balx]] art in the process of being transported to a safe location on [[🌱 Druxe]]. We can't engage in further military operations without risking damage to the art. We need you to go there and salvage as much as you can before the area inevitably devolves into chaos once again.

- **Pay: 125 CHT**

"Expedited Warning Of Advanced Necrosis","***[[Date: ~pc1,400|Passage Consideration]]***

Dear esteemed emperor [[Wyeku Aum]] of the 16th [[Dalha Empire]],

Please be advised thus by The High and Exalted [[Foretellers Enclave|The Foretellers Enclave]] of the [[Kromacvin]] Citadel: Our preeminent benders of the [[Opeqte|Voquev Opeqte]] have stumbled upon a dire issue regarding the Grand Pestle connecting [[⏳ Krom]] and [[The Mortar]] for some time now. In 617 years, an advanced case of void necrosis will have taken hold of the Door, and will have reduced it to nearly 23% capacity. The exact details of this event are not clear even to our [[Singular Foreteller|Cyr, Singular Foreteller]], though the probability for this case is approaching an eventuality. Please make haste to remedy this issue at once, lest the situation grow beyond mortal control.

The High and Exalted Foretellers Enclave realizes the Dalha Empire's reluctance to perform such duties, seeing as your life-spans are greatly reduced when compared to that of the Kromacvin. However, The Enclave wishes to extend a hand of diplomacy in regard to such an urgent matter. This issue affects not only our people, but also threatens trade, and the free flow of information between worlds.

Your response is awaited with fervor.

Signed, The High and Exalted Foretellers Enclave, 8th District, [[Singular City]], Krom

*Editor's Note: After receiving this letter from the Kromacvin Foretellers, it is said that the human Emperor Wyeku Aum flew into a bloody rage right in his own letter-opening palace. His opinion of the message (that it was in fact an utterance of great offence) caused him to incite a Grand Inquisition against the people of Krom. The Dalha Empire suffered great losses because of this, and was even temporarily dissolved due to internal conflict. Furthermore, it is speculated that the masses of troops that were sent across the Grand Pestle between the two worlds greatly furthered its state of void necrosis. No such further letters of this kind have since been sent by the Kromacvin.*

"Formation of The VDC","***[[Date: ~pc2,450|Passage Consideration]]***

When [[The 214th Isotoxal Compact]] was still in the early days of its foundation (at the time it was in its 78th iteration), its highest [[Sainthood]] Sacrosancts were gifted with visions of [[the divine|😇 gods]]. Specifically, [[Yyenwid Anctu]] (and possibly [[Yyenwid Ankno]]) acted as holy arbiter of a great social and commercial project to form the [[VDC]].

Though the god's intentions with the [[company|🏢 companies]] branch were clouded and indirect, many attribute this simply as a attempt by the deity to strengthen their worship and material presence in [[🌐 The Pantry]]. It has been noted by many historical scholars as one of only a few instances in (relatively speaking) recent memory that a god has been so involved in mortal affairs.

The consequences of this have of course been the widespread proliferation of the Vividh Deitos Conglomerate across The Pantry in [[Sparce|⚫ The Sparce]] hubs, dense cities, and nearly all Compact houses of worship. Furthermore, it cemented the god as one of a few figurehead deities representing the core values of the Compact.","20230411173627428","20220527183632643","","[[Yyenwid Anctu]] VDC [[📅 events]] [[Taqadum Period]]","text/x-markdown"

## **Backstory**

Harrison Simpleman is a half-giant half-halfling dude who averages out as a very human-looking, shape and size, boy-next-door. At night, he works as a barista at one of the town’s average-sized taverns and has no real family besides his regular customers. During the day, he wanders about, foraging herbs for his brewed drinks. He’s working towards saving up to hopefully one day move to the Big Apple, New York City, where dreams are made. He gets his superstrength from his mother but he didn’t follow in her footsteps of smashing things. Truth is, unlike everyone in his hometown, Harrison doesn’t want to fight. He could, oh he definitely could if he wanted to. But he just wants to be left at peace in his little corner in the brewery, brewing his herbs, coffee beans, infusions, or whatever his next concoction may be to make his regulars feel better about their day.

One day, one of his favourite regular customers came to him with a proposition: she would pay him extra to accompany her on an adventure and to brew his concoctions for her on the road, to keep her in top shape in-between combats. Harrison had one condition before he said yes: he won’t be killing anyone or anything during these combats. He will just nurture, nurse, and heal.","20230606201405925","20230508140712153","","[[Hinengaro Heist PCs]] [[🔒 private]] [[The Hinengaro Heist]] Humanoids","text/x-markdown"

## **Player characters**
 - [[Jebedda Habilitas]]
 - [[Emmaryn]]
 - [[K999/KIM]]
 - [[Dino (Prestidigious Hort)]]

## **Session notes**
- [[Emmaryn]] used the helm to land forcefully, which overcharged the engines
- They didn't persuade or reveal any info to the receptionist
- They angered [[The Browbeat]], and eventually dropped two large girders onto her
   - [[Jebedda Habilitas]] also tried to fake interview her
- They didn't initially say who they were hired by, and she namedropped ""The Baron"", ""The Snake"", and ""The Syndicate""
- They made the False Key with force, at 70% effectiveness
- They snuck out of the forge room, and confronted two [[Hinengaro registry|The Hinengaro Registry]] enforcers
- Made it out

## **Session goals**
- Start with a bang
- Get people comfortable with each other
- Some roleplay, but mostly puzzles and combat
- A twist, but not in a boring way

## **Timeline**

### **Awakening on the ship**
- Crew has been travelling on a retrofitted [[Horseshoe]] class starship
- It's taken them a few days to travel from [[🐐 Aaliat]], and now they're getting very close
- Each member slowly wakes up in the following order:
   1. **Emmaryn:** Low humming and whirring noises
   2. **Jebedda:** A small gravity failure warning
   3. **K999:** The whole ship starts to shake and list to the side
   4. **Dino:** Full klaxon and ship descent
- Possibilities for [[🪨 Remora]] story beats

### **Arrival on the star**
- If they query the helm (it may start up on its own):
   - The gravity of the star is far stronger than they had expected
   - An emergency landing can be attempted, but the ship will need some time to vent and recycle its engines
- They can try and angle the engines so that the ship lands safely *(DC 15-17 to know how to do this)*
- If all else fails, they crash land, rolling 1d4 damage as they impact. If this happens, the ship isn't usable on the return

> The star is a massive disc-shaped object. At its centre, light gathers so bright its almost hard to look at, and pure white energy spews up and down out into the Sparce. As you step out, your feet meet solid ground; a glassy floor made of solid light. Stardust and mist swirl about, slowly solidifying into columns, archways, and ceilings. You're enveloped in a forming environment, not unlike an enormous glowing train station.

### **Getting into the compound**
- A star magic empowered [[Construct|Constructs]] sits at a large elevated desk in front of an impossibly tall door
   - Genderless
   - Many dangly jewels
   - Light coming from with
   - Six arms, each embedded in a slot on the desk
   - Head follows them wherever they go
- Large banging and shaking can be heard from behind the door
- The Construct tells them that today is not a good day and that The Browbeat is in a fell mood
   - If they question further, they can find out that the [[Flowlines|🌌 The Flow]] that usually pass through the area have disapated
   - The star is slowly dying
   - She's losing control of the raw gravitational power within her
- They can:
   - Persuade *(DC 16) (DC 9 if they make it known who they're here on behalf of)*
   - Bribe *(DC 18)*
- Intimidation is met with no response
- They can barge in if they first distract the Construct *(DC 16)*

> As you enter, the doors open into another impossibly large chamber. This one however is nearly pitch black. On the far side of the room, the distance of three or four city blocks, the gigantic maw of a furnace sits open, embers smouldering within. Two or three Constructs walk here and there, moving giant tools, scrap metal, and glowing orbs.

> Hunched in front of the forge is The Browbeat. her upper torso protrudes from the ground, legs nowhere to be seen. Pure light forms her body, wrapped and draped like cloth about her. Upon her head rests a a crown with three burning stars set into it. Though her skin glows like the walls of the previous room, her eyes are deep empty black pools.

### **Fighting the star**
- She initially tells them to leave
- If they persist, she engages combat *(Hill Giant pg. 155)*
   - *Greatclub is 1d8 + 5*
   - *Rock is 1d10 + 5, and deals fire damage*
- If they barge in instead of convincing the Construct, she'll throw burning coals from the furnace *(Rock attack)*
- Fight lasts for 3 rounds, after which her rage subsides

### **Getting the key**
- After the fight, she calms down
   - The fight let her regain some limited strength
- She explains that their employer has agreed to divert shipment of raw [[🪨 Remora]] to her in exchange for the key
- A False Key needs care, but her strength is so erratic, she's afraid of breaking it
- However she doesn't have enough energy to make it alone
   - They can do it themselves, but it will be much more difficult
   - Or they can overload it by forging it physically, but this is much more volatile and less effective
   - If they overload it, she'll lose physical form for the next few decades
- If they do it themselves:
   - She aids them in opening their minds to the Key
   - They find themselves each in one of their memories, and must succeed on a respective saving throw
   - The amount that they succeed/fail by determines effectiveness
- If they brute force it, it's (2 * damage)% effective
   - They each have one turn to hit it with as much damage as they can
   - The star hits it too (with 3d10 + 5 fire damage)
   - 70

### **Escaping**
- While this is happening, [[Hinengaro registry|The Hinengaro Registry]] warrior monks have landed on the star
   - *Cult Fanatic pg. 345 and 2 Acolytes pg. 342*
- If they did it themselves, the star tells them to hide when they come back. They must sneak past the monks who enter
   - 3 sets of group stealth checks
   - If they're seen, a chase ensues
- If they work together, the star tells them to get out as fast as possible
   - 3 sets of combat-like escaping rounds to get out of the forge room
   - 1/3 chance that they're each struck by falling debris which deal 1d6 damage
   - Once they exit, they're confronted by the monks
   - If they didn't barge in, the Construct helps them by immobilizing the monks
- The Construct informs them to take the monks' ship if they crash landed 

### **Getting on their/a ship**
- If they didn't crash land, they can escape on their ship
- If they did, they can steal the monks' ship

## **Timeline**

### **Crew awakens**
- They had all previously congregated on a distribution warehouse in the [[🔴 inner ring]], where they were smuggled into shipping boxes bound for [[⚖️ Balx]]
   - They're going to meet with a contact, the local union boss, that [[C. A.|Copra Almorr]] had arranged. They need to meet him in the wildlife import section of the port on [[Iera]]

> After some hours of transport, during which some of you may have dozed, and some may have just listened, the cargo ship carrying you finally comes to a halt. Over the next 15-20 minutes or so, you can hear dock workers unloading packages around you. After a while though, a small whistle can be heard off in the distance, and footsteps lead away from you, off the ship. You're alone.

- They were each shipped in a different box
   - [[Svae Tsering]] has been shipped with dried tinctures make of crushed snakeskin
   - [[Harrison Simpleman]] has been shipped with wild medicinal herbs that make you sneeze
   - [[Tavalath Lightoath]] has been shipped with enclosed firecrackers

   - [[🪨 Remora]] shipments
   - Rations
   - Exotic fruits from [[🌱 Druxe]]
   - Music boxes from [[❤️ Yeima]]
   - Clothing from [[🐐 Aaliat]]

### **Making it through the port**

- First stealth check to make it out of the bay *(group DC 10-12)*
- While sneaking though they may hear some of the following:
   - That corporate pressure has been on them lately, what with union negotiations coming up, but that it's unusually marked by their physical presence
   - A squabble between two dock workers, due to the fact that one of them stole one of the exotic fruits
   - A lone worker stocking shelves, humming a tune that isn't too different from tunes heard of in the other [[Balx Formats|The Balx Formats]]
- Second stealth check to make it though the port *(group DC 14+)*
   - If they're found, they'll be quickly surrounded (see below)
- If they make it to the wildlife import section, their contact (the union boss) will give them amnesty
   - He will be waiting among various humanely-sedated [[Sparce Cows]], each in a [[helm|🧢 ship helms]] space

### **Being apprehended**

- If they're surrounded, they can try deescalating
   - Bribery or persuasion might work
   - Intimidation won't
- Interrogated on the spot by a cleric of the local [[Sainthood]]
   - She is tall, thin, and worships [[Voquev Tieraal]]
   - She casts Mold Earth to curve the ground in around them
   - She is smart and will listen to reason, but is fiercely dogmatic

> You feel a vibration beneath your feet, and the worn stone of the flat dockside seems to turn to sand. It curls up around you, forming into angled geometries. It points inward, keeping you from going further.

- If they continue to cause problems, or are deemed untrustworthy, they get locked up in quarantine (luminous curtains of light)
   - *Duergar (pg. 122)*
   - *Earth Elemental (pg. 124)*
   - Brought to separate rooms
   - They are questioned regarding their names, how they got there, and whether they are being paid well by the bosses
   - The Primordials in the group are particularly drilled
- Eventually they are released by the union boss
   - He gives them amnesty by offering them diplomatic passes
   - He cautions them not to do anything undiplomatic

### **The union meeting**

- Exposition regarding current state of affairs in labour
   - Due payments
   - Production schedule overview
      - The new [[Mortar|The Mortar]] causeways are going well, and will ship out soon
      - Increased contractor presence, so an encouragement to be on best behaviour
      - Negations with the government are also coming up
      - A delegation of transfer students from [[⛰️ Yadri]] will be coming in a couple months
- Note about the coming disc collision in 18 days
   - Fortifying battlements
   - Giving time for non-soldiers to move below ground
- Giving the party time to speak and ask questions
   - They explain that [[The Central Archive]] is folded like a folded paper sculpture
   - The further you get to the centre, the more difficult it is to work your way out. [[Prognost Caradil Yun]] will be nestled deep inside
   - It exists as a [[demi plane|🌑 demi planes]], wrapped impenetrably between the folds of  [[🌌 The Flow]]
   - The only way to get inside unwanted is through the use of a [[False Key|False Keys]], as it can open that which has no lock
   - The archives inside are limitless. Even [[The Hinengaro Registry]] isn't fully aware of how expansive it may fold open
   - To traverse within, one needs be well-versed in spatial folding. Without that, one can spend infinite eons walking the halls of the archive

### **Impending disc collision**

> As the workers are explaining this to you, far-off shouts can be heard from outside the warehouse. They continue, when suddenly, a door near the far end bangs open. A young Primordial boy, barges through, nearly toppling over. In through the door behind him blows hot air, and with it sand. It swirls viciously out along the floor. The boy is wide-eyed and panting. He says ""It's ahead of schedule. Riah is colliding! NOW!""

- Messenger barges in saying that [[Riah]] will be colliding ahead of schedule
   - [[Format Riah]] is taking advantage of [[Iera]]'s natural gravitational pull
   - All scatter
- The union boss tells them to go to the docks, and take a ship
   - They need to get off before chaos breaks loose
   - They are to meet Tsomo at the docks (an old retired worker)

### **Confrontation with Hinengaro representatives**

   - They had been stationed here to keep an eye on the union
- If the party resists, combat ensues
   - *2x Cult Fanatic (pg. 345) (20 HP each)*
   - Will only cast *Shield of Faith* or *Hold Person*
   - Each have a *Quarterstaff (1d6 blud.)* that causes *DC 12 
CON saving throws* to resist being knocked out (immune on success)
   - The retired dock workers cheer them on
- Otherwise, they will be taken into custody within the archive's holding chambers

## **NPCs**
- [[Kechok]]
- [[Sainthood]] representative
   - Dorjee
   - she/her
   - Magus
   - Tight-lipped, but respectful
- 2-3 [[Primorial|Primordials]] dock workers

## **Timeline**

**<u>NOTICE ABOUT THE EPILOGUE</u>**

### **Getting inside [[The Central Archive]]**

- Party 1 is being pursued by [[Hinengaro|Hinengaro Heist NPCs]] representatives
   - They take damage on one side, and a depressurization warning goes off
   - Appliances begin to shut down
   - Whoever is using the helm loses connection

> As the helm space dissolves in front of you, as the helmet itself retracts, the wide glass visor of the ship  opens up to an array of floating points in space; the lattice of the exterior of the archive. As you barrel towards it, starship blasts screaming past you, the very air around you seems to tremor, and snap.

- Party 2 starts tense, as they are passing through a security monitor towards a bent-open hole in space
   - They have arrived, posing as maintenance workers on [[Kechok]]'s behalf
   - So far, they haven't been met with much resistance, in fact, everything seems short staffed
   - They are given communication beetles, which affix themselves to their necks, and asked to relay their progress when they've finished adjusting the binding tether tension
   - Helm use to get inside

> As your borrowed starship glides out of the maintenance receiving bay, and into the archive proper, the enormity of the space truly opens itself up to you. You land on the floor of an enormous hangar, deserted, quiet, and infinitely tall. Far, far above you, floating pathways criss-cross like blades of grass, and glints of light, as if reflected on a mirror, dance around you.

- Back to party 1
   - The [[False Key|False Keys]] begins to manifest for each of them
      - They each get to choose what it looks like
      - However, it behaves in a paradoxical manner (the lock already being open, they being no lock at all, the lock unlocking the key, the key unlocking the self)
   - Space opens up before them, and they pass into the archive, crash-landing

- The groups unite

### **Meeting the local population**

- A devoted [[Kromacvin]] clerical order resides within, and they crowd about the two starships
   - The newest members were born here, the oldest on just before its construction 20-25 years ago
   - They aren't aggressive, and will help guide the players further if asked (though they're shy)
   - Clothed in flowing blue robes, similar to those worn by the Registry, but without sigils or markers. Plain cloth and training gowns
- Their society is formed of rituals of categorizing, containing, and navigating object within the archive brought to them by [[The Hinengaro Registry]]
   - They know only ritual, and think [[Yyenwid Modsiw]] to be the only god
- To transport, vertices within the folded lattice must be found, and through a painful ritual, unfolded
   - The deeper inside one gets, the harder it is to perform, and the longer one must wait after doing so
- The locals are wary of Hinengaro presence, and thus usher them through one such doorway

### **Making it through the archives**

- Before each jump can be made, a [riddle](PDFs/riddles.pdf) must be answered
   - The locals are immune due to their biological adaptation
   - As the party passes through, they are brought to a mini pocket dimension, where the cosmic eye of [[Yyenwid Modsiw]] watches them from above
   - Riddles are transmitted wordlessly to their heads

> **Wind**
> No one can hold me
> In their palms or sight;
> I scatter sudden clatter
> Far and wide.
> I want to hammer oaks
> With mournful might;
> Yes, I strike sky
> And scour countryside.

- The first archive they visit is the document archive
   - Rows upon rows of infinitely tall shelves, with racks
   - Local populace can be seen here and there stocking and organizing
   - Large crossroads nearby where The Self-Containing Ledger is kept
- [[Cathrine]] offers to come with them as a guide
- Moving on, their guide finds it difficult to open a door

> **Needle**
> What is it that’s blind with an eye in its head, but the Pantry its use cannot spare; spends all its life clothing the dead, but always itself is naked and bare?

- The second archive is the biological one
   - Maze of glass boxes in what feels like an underground facility
   - Some boxes larger, and here the ceiling rises up
   - A few local keepers, but far less than before
- In one of the areas that they pass through has within it a [[Librarian]], introducing a food supplement to a tank of ancient [[🐟 Sparce wildlife]]
- This third jump is particularly difficult, and their guide even struggles for a moment
   - Opportunity to help them keep it open with a strength check

> **Fork**
> I’ve stabbed more dead beasts than any man’s sword. I’m simple to craft, but I belong with a lord.

- The third archive is the technological & research-focused one
   - An enormous facility, with piping and staircases all about
   - Some areas are larger, like hangars, others are smaller like offices or labs
   - Signs pointing off to: Ongoing Research, Prized Collection,  Spell Experimentation, and Time Catalogue
- Only a single local can be found here, toiling away trying to order frozen moments of time
- The last jump is the hardest, and the guide can get the crack upon, but it requires some of the party members to hold it open to get through *(STR check DC 15)*

> **Candle**
> What is the sister of the sun, Though made for the night? The fire causes her tears to fall, And when she is near dying they cut off her head.

### **Final lock puzzle**

- Upon coming through, the door closes, but cracks splinter off into space, and hang there
- They are gathered at the tip of a teardrop-shaped room, with an elevated back half
   - In the far back is an enormous sheet draped over a 40ft-tall rectangular object
   - At the back is a luxurious bed, overflowing with blankets and pillows. So much so that they spill off onto the floor and level below
   - In the bed is [[Prognost Caradil Yun]], enfeebled
   - He awakens as they approach the bed
- Chance for someone to see through the enchantment
- Caradil brings them over to the painting, revealing that he never even started it
- As they talk further, he realizes why they're there
   - He knows that information is leaking in, and he wants out
   - In defence of his own skin (literally), he gets paranoid and defensive
- Reveal that the bed never existed, he's much taller and more emaciated, and that the artwork is in fact a series of body-spanning tattoos
- Combat ensues

### **Combat**

[img[images/TAG/prognost_caradil_yun.png]]
[img[images/TAG/caradil_fight.png]]

- As his Reveal of Countenance happens, the presence of [[Yyenwid Modsiw]] briefly leaves him
   - Like this, he is shown to be completely totally vacant, both in mind and nearly in body

- [[Dino (Prestidigious Hort)]]
   - He's transported to the crowd of a kickboxing match where [[Leilland]] is fighting. She spots him during the fight, everything melts away, and she explains that he melded into her and lost his physical form. She's angry at him for not being there, as he swore to be
   - In the battlefield that he arose in, while the pull of death tries to keep him down
- [[Emmaryn]]
   - The [[Florafolk]] vines within them trying to coexist within the meat of the [[Kromacvin]] body. A struggle for sunlight and nutrients
   - A combined body, followed and cornered by their family in a trading port
- [[Harrison Simpleman]]
   - Being forced to fight in a summer games in his hometown
   - An angry cat is cornered behind his store, and it attacks him before running away
- [[Jebedda Habilitas]]
   - In a dingy [[🪨 Remora]] den, and the sensory overload is hitting
   - Trying to write an art critic take on a particular work, and failing to see any originality in it or any of the last years' work
- [[K999/KIM]]
   - At an awards ceremony for [[Yyenwid Terneh]], surrounded by many talented artists and figured, and no one will pay attention to her
   - A conversation between two processor systems within her 'brain'. One is asking more and more for a core memory file that can't be found
- [[Ribley]]
   - Lost in the woods of [[Ytin]], with dense foliage and strange creatures about
   - In the belly of a large cargo ship, starving and unable to scrounge any food
- [[Svae Tsering]]
   - An emotional childhood memory of fire, anger, and being pursued
   - Being trained by [[Cormac Seadh]], but unable to contain anger
- [[Tavalath Lightoath]]
   - Fighting with [[Voquev Thimdeit]] in a shattered asteroid ring. Their anger tries to take them out of the moment, but the god resists
   - In an infinite plane of grassy fields, as it starts to rain

### **Getting out**

- Opportunity to record the tattoos, take pictures, or perhaps even take his body
- His death releases a pulse that starts to unfurl the archive from inside
   - As this happens, different archives start to blend in, and with them, the locals
   - Even the flickers in and out, its movements erratic
- As it unravels, [[Cathrine]] appears, informing them that the folded structure is unwrapping, but it won't last for long
   - The natural mass equilibrium of the universe will push back against the expanding size, and squeeze it back down to natural size
   - However, she can send them anywhere they want to go in these moments as the archive's control points go spinning across [[🌐 The Pantry]]
- They can choose to go to [[Copra Almorr]]
   - If they do so, they tumble out of space and onto the large circular table in a secret feast hall
   - Underworld kingpins gathered all around
   - The wealth of information gained by scrutinizing the tattoos will prompt the invention of new technologies, religions, and physical properties
   - Copra offers them their full sum, and a seat at his table

- **<u>Where does everyone go from there?</u>**

"Humming In The Dark","***[[Date: ~pc2,400|Passage Consideration]]***

Scuttling about in the dark, his hand brushed over something smooth. A momentary pause was had, and panic rose up in his chest for but a moment. He pounded it back down with as much mental force as possible, and slowly crept his other hand towards his side lantern. Withdrawing for a moment, he lit the wick, and low orange brilliance scattered about the cramped cave. Aware of the time limit he had just imposed upon himself, he reached up, back towards the flat surface he had fumbled across. In a half-heave, half-lunge motion, he pulled himself up and over the surface. He quickly righted himself and, crouching now as to not bump his head on the fractal roof of the cave, knelt on the almost shelf-like flat protrusion. He studied it but for a moment, its black and very slightly transparent surface humming with the premonition of its contents. His prize, and a large one at that. Reaching from behind, he produced a long curved instrument. Speaking the arcane words, now familiar to him after months of practice, the arc-beam crackled from end to end of the arched tool. Immediately, he set to work holding the beam down flat against the glass-like surface. The humming from within intensified, almost to a fever pitch, and with his last ounces of stretch applied, the flatness below him crunched and shattered.

He now knelt in about 10cm of very cold liquid, almost paste-like in thickness. He wasted no time, reaching into the pool, pushing aside bits of broken shards. His hands grasped object after object. Compasses, half-eaten loaves of bread, small devotional figures, a child's wicker ball, three glass eyes, and many more such trinkets. Each find was quickly stashed in his bag, leaving a thick and dark residue on his hands and pack. All that could be easily scavenged was, and before long, the pool was nearly empty. One final grope around was met with the iron-wrought hilt of some stave or halberd. This was the last item to be wrenched from the muck before he hastily climbed back down, landing amidst the cracked stone and uneven floor. Immediately, he shut off his lantern and, knowing the returning path well, proceeded down the corridors. He had not made it 3 minutes before he heard the crackling behind him. Running faster now, as the sound approached, he could see the cave system collapsing in and out of reality. Making it to the [[Pestle|🚪 pestles]] Door in just enough time, he flung himself across its barrier, and landed soundly on soft-grassed ground. Not 3 seconds later, the Door had shuddered, wracked its form, and crumped up completely.

Dusting himself off, he tied the oblong metal staff to the underside of his pack, and rolled up the Door as if a carpet *(see [[Portable pestles]])*, and started his trek down the hill towards the village. Another successful trip, and completed with not a moment to lose. Who knows what [[⏳ Krom]] would give to him next? Only time would tell.","20230605013949800","20220512012035864","","[[⏳ Krom]] [[🔒 private]] [[Hīkoi Period]] [[Portable pestles]] [[📜 myths and stories]]","text/x-markdown"

"Introduction","Welcome to The Pantry, a mystic sci-fi fantasy universe of scattered worlds, fractioned gods, and far stretches of empty space. This ancient expanse between planes and solid ground might seem barren and lawless to those bound to worldly life, but The Sparce is far from desolate. From out of the void rise dark horrors, the magical Flow lines of life, and budding empires. People of the Sparce are hardy, practical folk, who recognize the difficulty of working, living, and thriving in such an environment. The resources, freedom, and most importantly adventure that stems from this infinite darkness between planes draws them all in. On starships large and small, they brave the fathoms, and turn void into home.

## **Backstory**

K999 is a 42 year old construct. Designed to be a fashion assistant of socialites she gained the attention of the fashion god Ye (Idk what his name is, but I’m going with Ye now) as K999 was accompanying one of her clients to a party where Ye was present. Ye was attracted to K999 and saw potential and a way to increase their popularity. 

K99 is short, only 1.57m and has had numerous procedures done to her lips, eyes, brow, jaw, cheek, breasts, abs, and most notably her ass. Where she previously sported a very curvaceous look she has recently slimmed down to slightly more realistic, yet still inhuman proportions.

K999 and Ye married and the wedding day was an extremely elaborate event. Having made an oath of devotion to Ye she promised to always look good and represent contemporary unaffordable streetwear for people that live in gated communities. Through a surrogate, Ye and K999 have four children North, Saint, Psalm and Pantry. All of them are incredibly ill-behaved and mostly raised by nannies.

K999 did elevate the work of Ye to world fame, but unfortunately, the couple divorced about two years ago. The lawsuit was a mess as Ye turned out to be a bit bipolar and K999 wanted full custody for the children she did not raise. After a year they eventually settled and shared custody and some resources. 

The divorce was a big blow for K999 as she is losing relevancy fast. She is desperate to keep her name relevant and her picture taken to hold on to her divine powers. Luckily she still has connections with a lot of high-profile people in entertainment. She is using this network to be spotted at as many events as possible. She is willing to do anything if it would bring her popularity.

She met the rest of the party at the tavern where she was promoting weight loss potions for a sponsor deal.","20230511010232793","20230508140813085","","[[Hinengaro Heist PCs]] [[🔒 private]] [[The Hinengaro Heist]] Constructs","text/x-markdown"

"Open Vantage","***[[Date: pc926|Passage Consideration]]***

Falltime was waning, and the winter colds were starting to set in around the footholds of the Bruevar mountains. However, sunlight still clung to the snow in great swaths, and the vantage was far from obscured. For this, Adreat was thankful. For her short life of twelve winters, she’d studied and been raised on these spires, cared for by her grandmother and her father. The Bruevar were a collection of three squat but pointed mountains along the southern bank of the great Braurun mountain range. She had been born here, and voyages down towards the base of the hills were far and few between. Nested quietly about the base of the range were deep quagmires where fell beasts dwelt. Or so she was told. Her father, the Mat-Allister of these Bruevar Mountains, was native to those lands and so often wove tales and spun charms which told of dark lurking eyes between the fading trees. He spent most of his time walking lightly in the deep and silent places of the mountain, and so Adreat was only with her father when he returned from the mountain for supper in the evenings. Her grandmother, or Greemaw, was her one and only guide to the life and temperament of the peaks she inhabited. She was a wise and powerful teacher, for she had been bestowed a birthright of immense physical strength from their ancestors; a gift of forebears. Though Adreat had no such gift, nor the arcanity of a Mat-Allister, she was learning and would assume her Greemaw’s duties in ample time.

For the past three and a half weeks, they had been preparing for the oncoming of winter. In some weeks time, winds from great deserts and far flung seas beyond imagination would carry cold and harsh winds to the Dorminndar range, and all would be engulfed in threshing sleet. During the long winters, Adreat and her family would gather their summer and falltime placements and retreat up to the safety of the high grottos and caves. The antler-sheep and sextupedal mountain goats would be released for the year, and food, milk, and other provisions would be stashed. In those dark months, they would be sealed away deep inside the forgotten tombs of their predecessors. Adreat’s father had once told her that their lineage deep down in and around the Bruevar mounts was so ancient that if you followed it back further enough, it would be indistinguishable from the very roots of the mountains.

For the past two years, Adreat had accompanied her Greemaw for one of the final tasks before their ascent: the collection of fresh water to be stored for winter. For fear of contamination by the encroaching wastelands that ringed the mountains, only the snow on the high and shining peaks could be stored. However, this year, desperation clung fast to her father and her Greemaw’s faces. The summer had been lackluster and windy, and the usually plentiful antler-sheep herds had been shallow. Because of this, her Greemaw spent more than half of her day hunting other mountain game to be cured, smoked, and stored for the winter. This was how the task fell solely to Adreat. To climb high towards the peaks, and bring down the pure snow that fell there.

They had bided their time, and waited for a proper sunny day to send her up. Lo it came, one early morning when a brilliant sun crested the jagged horizon. Adreat set off at once, so that she might get a head start if the weather was to change throughout the day. Though her Greemaw wasn’t joining her, she wouldn’t send her granddaughter up the mounts alone. Adreat was to bring Neraline, their mariarch sextupedal goat, with her to help carry skins of snow back down. Her six hooves, perfectly adapted to the shale and ice of the mountain, would guide the pair along their trek. Leaving the falltime encampment, they wound up the gooseberry bath. Passing these semi-cultivated bushes and tinkling shrines with burning incense, they rose. An hour later and all but a few purposefully cut trail blazes, placed there by Adreat’s great-great-uncle, marked their climb. Soon they reached [[Goleade|Voquev Gol'iead]], Last Shrine To Open Vantage, and this was their sign to start making their way unguided. By now, they had been scaling the dwindling footholds for three hours, and breathing had become tiresome. Adreat was familiar with this sensation; her father had once told her that the reason that the mountains choke nearer to their summits was because that’s where their memories were. She had not understood her father, but she believed every word he said. Behind them the sky was hazy with fog, and far across the tops of the spires, she could see rain falling. Or was it sleet? She couldn’t tell. Pressing into Neraline’s wool, she guided her faster.

They had been passing snow for some time now, but still Adreat was worried that it wouldn’t be pure enough. They would make for the small plateau ahead, rest for a quarter of an hour, then make the final push to the summit. Upon reaching the flat outcropping, there was barely enough room for her and Neraline to rest, but it was enough. Around them was only rock, snow, and sky. The last trace of animal life had disappeared an hour ago, and human long before that. All she could see now was the rolling snow-fog and occasional lower mountain summit. Somewhere deep and quiet, thunder rumbled. Adreat knew that ignoring it would do no good, only preparation and good constitution would help them now. After a small bite, Adreat with some old and tough lamb, and Neraline with old and tough roots, they continued. So close they were now, and the top was in sight. A hundred paces and they would halve the distance. Fifty paces to halve that. Twenty-five to in turn halve that. Now, and only now, were they stopped. They were so high that only the Dormunn Spires to the north and the Sødar Mount to the west could be seen. As only her grandmother, great-great-uncle, and great-great-great-grandfather had done before her, she rung the small golden bell that was fastened to the coronet of the mountain. She heard no sound but knew that an identical bell, placed down within the antechamber of the mountain caves would be ringing at that very moment, signalling her climb’s success to her father and grandmother.

Now was the time. She hastily began shovelling bright white snow into the sheepskins draped and hung from Neraline’s back. Even packing it as tightly and quickly as she was, it was a slow task. For half an hour now, the far and deep rumbling of a sleet thunder storm had been growing louder and closer. Both climbers were aware of this fact, and were beginning to worry. Neraline’s shuffling hooves belayed her nervousness. The moment that the last skin had been packed tight and secured, Adreat begane hastening them back down. The trip down was by far the most dangerous part of the task. Wet shale, hidden ice, and indistinguishable plant growth were mighty adversaries. While the six feet of the native mountain goat were borne for traversing exactly such a terrain, Adreat’s reinforced leather high-tops here having some difficulties. By now, extremely cold raindrops had started to fall on their backs, and the two had to slow down even more. Suddenly and cacophonously, a great white hot scream of lightning careened into the black stone not metres from their feet, and in less than a second everything changed. Stone, fire, snow, and hair clouded Adreat’s vision while she was flung into the air. Caught on hot winds suctioned up from lower on the mountain, she was spun and almost held momentarily in the gust. Then she was dropped. Hard.

She awoke, and all was white brilliance. Climbing up through the snow, the way her grandmother had taught her, she erupted in a dark chaos. It was night now, and the great sweeping arms of a snowy tempest raged about her on the mountaintop. Above and around, they seemed to form great beasts of the mountain, unthinkable in form. Steadying her soul and her mind, she peered through the wailing storm, searching for her hircine companion. Some hundred metres below her, she spied Neraline. She was huddled and small against what could one have been an outcropping of stone, and was now only a charred and jagged edge of rubble. In the midst of her climb down to Neraline, Adreat absentmindedly noted that the rocks where the great bolt of lightning had struck were still warm to the touch.

The tempest covered their tracks back up almost immediately after they made them, but their direction was clear. Down. Down to warmth, down to family, down to survival. Progress was unbearably slow, as great swaths of burning hail careened at mach speed into their flesh. It was only after an hour of climbing that Adreat realized she was screaming. She didn’t stop. Amid the dread chorus of flying snow, rolling thunder, and her own hoarse wails, she suddenly recognized the harmony. Great gusts and the very furrowed brow of the mountains were twisting and mingling to the sound of her guttural screams. Adreat could feel as sleet and rock passed above, below, and through her. With no understanding or control of her newfound sense, she plunged headfirst into it, breaking open her mind and her body. Blood flung from between her knuckles and under her eyes, and an avalanche of chanting carried the girl and the goat to the brink of unconsciousness. Flashes of light and slow dotted Adreat’s memory as her body and soul, and that of her sextupedal goat companion, were lost to the mountain’s roar. Passing through stone, sky, and ice, they rocketed down the spire.

In the coming months, her Greemaw and her father would tell the story of how Adreat and Neraline had appeared the next early morning unscathed, on the doorstep of the mountain cave system. Adreat herself had no recollection of events that passed after she lost consciousness the second time on the mountain. As for the storm, she was told that a great cloud of fog and snow had formed about the peak not long after the bell had rung, and had all but completely disappeared by the morning light. In the coming days, Neraline rejoined the herd, and stayed with them in the winter months while Adreat and her family were up in the caves. The following year, in late summer, she died peacefully in old age. Many summers and many winters would pass before another would be trained to scale the mountain peak again. For that time, it was Adreat only who undertook the task each year. Though there were storms, they never seemed to trouble her. She knew now the secrets of the mountain, for it had told them to her in that black place during the descent. A gift, different to those given to her now old father and late Greemaw continued to guide her. Occasionally she would delight her own grandchildren by awakening the winds and snow around them during bitter autumn nights. When she died at the old mountain folk age of seventy three, her bones and her light quieted and melded with those of the mountain from which she had come, and she was one again with her ancestors.","20230605013949803","20220512010406365","","[[⛰️ Yadri]] [[🔒 private]] [[Aetivima Period]] [[📜 myths and stories]]","text/x-markdown"

"Rain Upon Loam","***[[Date: pc893|Passage Consideration]]***

Vashmat sat, legs bent together, on the slick stone. The rain, thick and diagonal, pelted down on the side of his face. It stung, burning with a soft warmth. Below him, underneath the dark stone shelf which protruded from the loamy soil, people fled along the fields. Though his eyes were shut, Vashmat could hear the sounds of conquest spilling along his lands ahead, coming ever closer. Though individuals rushed past on all sides, and the rain formed cold muddy puddles around his sitting form, he sat still. Face calm, with arms bent and reposed. On the air he could smell the petrichor of the sky, and marvelled at the vast beauty of his country.

One of the fleeing figures fell at his side. High up though he was on the stone outcropping, the fallen [[Giant|Giants]]'s eyes were nearly level with his own, its size was so large. The great being's body was broken, and it bled thick grey ichor from his nose and back. Quietly Vashmat rose, opening his eyes for the first time in three hours. The burnt rubble of his homeland now stretched beyond the horizon, and he could see similar pale fleshy fallen Giants splayed out, emanating from a central dark scorch mark upon the fields. The Giant to his left, now opening its own eyes, turned them upon Vashmat.

Wordlessly, the being twisted its broken arm, and pulled itself closer. The Giant's third eye, located in the palm of its hand was glaucomized and milky, sundered by some dark schism. It reached its hand down, and cupped it around Vashmat's thin frame. Vashmat placed his hands on the Giant's weeping blind eye, and told it of his fears and joys. The large being listened, silent and reverent as it had been when there was peace. When Vashmat was finished, the rot spreading from the crater on the land's surface had seeped and festered, turning the plains and their grasses to sullen ash.

The Giant spoke only one phrase to the boy, cradling him delicately in its palm:

## **Backstory**

Ribley's excitement is contagious. While they might not always be able to tell you what they are so enamoured by, their enthusiam is never lost. Ribley's parents will tell you that their energy started at a young age, where her passion for the world around them was fleeting but alluring. They seemed to just disapear only to be found by their parents exploring a new skill, artifact, or just something cute. Eventually this curiousity got Ribley into trouble - though she might argue differently. On one particularily beautiful spring day, Ribley found herself in the presence of local fey who matched her enthusiasm and curiousity. Ribley disapeared for a week, and upon return regaled their family about the wonders of such a time. The stories always seem to change slightly, but it is clear that Ribley spent time in the Fey realm ( a week for their family but years for them). Ribley always mentions the circus, a group of Fey's who traveled around to different realms and cities, but no one from Ribley's family ever seems to have heard it. While some call Ribley a silly storyteller, it was undeniable the impact of the circus on their life. Ribley's back had begun to grow different fungi, none that seemed to be harmful, but magical in nature. These mushrooms seemed to give them power, allowing them to read minds, manipulate water into weapons, and even alter luck in their favour. Ribley's community was scared of their newfound power, and after ""the incident"" which led to a few injuries, they were asked to leave. Heading on their way and scared for ""the incident"", Ribley was looking for someone to take her in. They lived among the shadows, scavenged (or arguablly stole) for food, until meeting a few others that were not scared of Ribley's fey-touched life. They formed a team, and Ribley was rejuvinated with purpose. They might not know how long they stick with this robin-hood esque band, but for now they are using what they have been giving, and seeking ways to recreate the warmth of the circus they once loved. They don't want to a carny, but they loved the chaotic family it created and Ribley hopes to find that with their crew, or at least until they forget and find something else to excite them.","20230511010507396","20230508140830969","","[[Hinengaro Heist PCs]] [[🔒 private]] Zoofolk [[The Hinengaro Heist]]","text/x-markdown"

Though mostly unwelcome in [[The Sparcian Commonwealth]] territories, some sabbatical members have been known to travel vast distances out into the far reaches of [[🌐 The Pantry]].","20220207014000317","20220207013316337","","[[The Planar Convoke]]","text/x-markdown"

"Session 0 template","## 1. **Game tone**
- What types of roleplaying games have people played before? How much have they played?
- What were the tones of those games? (*e.g.* gritter & realistic, comedic, fairy tale, treasonous, heroic, horror, etc.)
- If we had to give the session a TV/film rating what would it be? (*i.e.* E, PG, R)
- Are we comfortable with possible player character death?
- Are we comfortable with secrets between players?
- How many sessions do we want to have?

***Tonal recap with unanimous approval***

## 2. **Comfort and disclaimers**
- All roleplaying games are fundamentally vulnerable activities. We act like weird kids for 3-4 hours while rolling plastic rocks. But its vulnerability is also what liberates us from the terrifying and exhausting pace of adult life. *It's good to be be goofy, lean into it.* However, if there are ever moments of discomfort, however small, you can always let me know. We'll talk it out, omit or fast-forward sections, revise histories, and adapt our own play styles to make sure that everyone is having a good time.
- Bigotry, trolling, or harassment is not allowed. This applies to both in and out of character, unless your character has a legitimately good reason to do so
- If you're ever made uncomfortable by anyone at the table or the things that happen in-game, you can always talk to me private

## 3. **Setting**
- What types of setting have people played in before? (*e.g.* high fantasy, science fiction, historical, low fantasy, etc.)
- Does the group want to use my setting?
- If yes, discuss the following:
   - Setting ethos/vibe (*i.e.* Firefly + socialism + dragons, godly influence, equity at the forefront)
   - Planes/Sparce
   - Races
   - Politics
- If yes, introduce this wiki
- If yes, do they want the campaign to take place in The Sparce, or between the planes? Do they want to have roles on a starship?
- Of no, what kind of setting do they want to play in?

***Setting recap with unanimous approval***

## 4. **House rules**
- Milestone levelling
- [[Player house rules]]
- Any house rules that people don't want to use?
- I'll try almost always to never say outright no to something, however, we may need to adapt certain actions or character creation choices to something that fits the setting or narrative better

## 5. **Character creation (in no particular order)**
- Individuals
   - Mechanical aspects (*i.e.* race, class, background)
   - Personality aspects (*i.e.* bond, ideals, flaws)
   - Backstory (max one page)
   - *What is your motivation for adventuring?*
   - Tell 1-2 facts about your character (don't have to be interesting)
- Group
   - How do the characters know each other?
   - How long have they known each other?
   - What is the group motivated by? (*e.g.* salary, revenge, crisis, curse)

## 6. **Scenarios**
- One each from the 3 pillars of D&D will be chosen, and we'll meander through them to help get a feel for our characters
- This is purely non-canonical (unless we all decide that it is)
- After this, you're free to change any aspects of your characters

"Taqadum Period","***[[Start date: ~pc2,300 (length: 250 years)|Passage Consideration]]***

A short span of very emotional and liberating centuries following the [[Aetivima Period]]. During its length, it saw the first rise of mortal democracy and social justice. The fomentations and atrocities of the past were atoned for, and new orders of civilization came about.

Its movements and core tenets were awareness of the past, strong justice for oppressors (many of which included power-zealous [[Oleald]]), and a credo for the future. Many new organizations and traditions came out of the newfound freedom, such as the [[The Starship Charter]], the [[Formation of The VDC]], and [[🪨 Remora]] decriminalization.

## **Backstory**

Male, appears to be 18 years old but actually 86 (spent 68 years travelling the astra sea -- I took the [Astral Drifter](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/background:astral-drifter) background) 

I am on this journey (with the party) because I am looking for Candles of the Deep (wondrous item; candles that cannot be extinguished when immersed in water). I learnt about them when on my travels through the astral sea and have returned to land to convert all of the candles encrusted into my form into this type of candle. 

I have a debilitating fear of water, because extinguishing the candles on my body causes me damage. 
I have this fear of water because of the wars raged against my people by the Format Uidi. 

I left my home Format on a nomadic journey through the Astral Sea to find peace and greater communion with my god, to discover inner peace, but still have an intense capacity for destruction, strength, and violence. Despite this, I try to find peace within my heart. 

During combat, I enter into communion with my god, entering a trance state (“rage”) in which I act from an out-of-body place. (just like the avatar state); I have next to no awareness of what is happening when I enter this trance. I always come down hard from these trance states, feeling both the whiplash of such an intense communion with the one I worship, while also feeling guilty for all of the destruction that I caused while I was not aware of my own surroundings. While on the material quest of transformation which can protect me from water, I am also on a quest for greater peace and pacifism. This is the reason why i left my home in the first place to wander the Astral plane. I am never more at peace than when I am having a perfect mug of tea, warming my hands.","20230606212207351","20230508140802322","","[[Hinengaro Heist PCs]] [[🔒 private]] [[The Hinengaro Heist]] Primordials","text/x-markdown"

It was founded [[pc2,372|Passage Consideration]].

Every few years, a census is taken, and any new gods/religions that that have cropped up in the elapsed time are incorporated, and a new Compact is signed. As the current name suggests, this has happened 214 times so far.

As a [[pantry|🌐 The Pantry]]-wide organization, they take no particular side between [[The Planar Convoke]] and [[The Sparcian Commonwealth]], but often make deals with and operate inside of both.

A strange, oblong [[starship|🚀 starships]] made as an experiment by [[The Sparcian Commonwealth]], but seldom used until picked up by [[the party|Crystal Ship PCs]]. Almost teardrop-shaped in appearance, with a pointed front end and a bulbous back end. In combat, its front end splits open, revealing 8 articulated hydraulic arms which are used to grapple other ships, or manipulate large objects in zero-gravity.

The engine, though not requiring room for a boiler or combustion area, is still large. While the [[helm|🧢 ship helms]] channels the raw mental energy of the [[Helmsperson]], the engine turns it into thermal energy. Mounted along the wall and ceiling, the engine is a mess of tubes and small combustion chambers. It recycles magically-infused liquid through its cycle, and uses this to evoke fire out of the exhaust.

*Though strange in its construction, the ship has a delightfully homey feel. Warm and muted colours decorate the interior, and the smell of old incense seems to worm itself everywhere. Though closely packed, the rooms are well furnished, and all seem to lead in towards the central common room. Its exterior paint coat is a standard industrial grey and orange, streaked here and there with Remora residue. It appears to only have been flown a few times.*

"The Hinengaro Heist","Dearest accomplices,

I hope this private letter finds you well. It has not been long since your employment to me began, but you have already proved yourselves quite handy in a pinch. Your efforts to reappropriate wealth under my direction have not gone unnoticed. I present you now with a chance to solidify our business partnership.

As you may have recently heard, there have been whispers and pan-Pantry news circulations that seem to suggest that Prognost Caradil Yun, a high ranking official of The Hinengaro Registry previously though to be dead, has returned to the public eye. However, my inside sources tell me that the other Keepers of Countenance (the religious officials that run The Hinengaro Registry) are not happy with this turn of events.

I have been informed that Prognost Yun has been imprisoned in depths of the Registry's largest off-plane archive for attempting to bring The Registry's patron god, Yyenwid Modsiw, into physical form through the use of a long-lost illustration technique. For the sake of freedom of information and the new business opportunities this illustration may bring, it has to be liberated.

I'm tasking you with the following:
1. Travel to The Browbeat Crucible, a living star on the far side of the Bhava province, to forge a False Key. With it, you will be able to gain access to the archive.
2. Meet with the workers of an Earth Primordial mining town on Balx, who constructed the archive, and know its passages inside and out. Find out where they might be keeping Prognost Caradil Yun.
3. Convene at the central Hinengaro Registry archive, which floats in orbit in the Inner Ring. Break in, make it through, and get out with the illustration.

The first two goals should be doable in smaller groups, but you will need your full combined strength to make your infiltration on the archive itself. Upon completion of the task, you will each be rewarded to the tune of 6,000 chits. Furthermore, please find enclosed 125 chits for any business expenses that may crop up. I wish you good luck and good health. Regards,

C. A.

"The Monk on The Winding Road","***[[Date: ~pc4,000|Passage Consideration]]***

The Monk was walking steadily down [[The Winding Road]], following its well-trodden footpaths, shortcuts, and deviations. The day was bright, and the cold in the air bit playfully against his skin. He had been walking through the night, though he was not tired. The Winding Road had a way of carrying one along, as if on some unseen current. Beside The Monk walked his spirit. His mental image, alike in both mannerism and in form. The two kept each other company, and often commented on the various things that they saw while walking. It was naught but a few hours after the sun had risen and The Monk was passing down the backside of a rolling mountain that he passed a group of merchants. As they approached, they nodded to The Monk. He in turn reciprocated, as did his spirit, though the merchants could not see it. The merchants stopped to ask The Monk directions, as they had been traveling for some time, and had yet to pass by a town or city in which to sell their goods. The Monk told them that he had passed a small mountain hamlet not two peaks back, and that if they hurried they might make it by nightfall, though one could never be certain when walking on The Winding Road. The merchants thanked The Monk, and gave him bread and oil, as was the custom. The monk nodded to them again, as did his spirit, and he carried onwards. The Monk ate the bread as he walked, and offered the oil to his spirit as a ceremonial gesture. His spirit politely declined. The Monk told his spirit how thankful he was to have been met with such kind folk. His spirit agreed, and mentioned how rare that was these days.

Sometime later, The Winding Road on which The Monk was walking diverged. The Monk stopped at the crossroads, unsure of which path to take. His spirit, contrarian in nature, wanted to take the right path which appeared to lead back up and along the mountain. The Monk however was hesitant. He thought that the left path, which appeared to lead down towards the valley, was the proper one. And so, The Monk and his spirit sat down on two rocks nestled beside the fork in the road, and contemplated. The Monk's spirit reminded him that The Winding Road was fickle, and that the left path that appeared to be proper might in fact lead them completely astray. The Monk agreed that yes, The Winding Road was fickle, however he mentioned that the fickler thing still would be if the proper-looking left road was in fact the proper one. At this, his spirit fell silent, thinking. They both mused for some time, and came to the eventual conclusion that their discussion could very easily become cyclical. They had been sitting, and talking, and grumbling for some time near the fork in the road when suddenly an old Aspen Ghost walked out from the brush. The Aspen Ghost came and sat next to The Monk's spirit, and struck up a conversation with it. The Monk himself could not understand a word of what The Aspen Ghost was saying, but his spirit appeared to be having a good conversation. After some time, The Monk's spirit told him that The Aspen Ghost knew which way to go, but would only tell them if he could be given a proper place to rest. The Monk stood then, nodding to The Aspen Ghost, and walked over to a small forest grove next to the fork in the road. He gently ripped aspen saplings and ferns from the ground, and returned to the fork in the road. He bundled the saplings and ferns together, and wedged the bundle into the top of a pile of stones. He lit the bundle ablaze, and stood back to admire his work. The Aspen Ghost clapped his hands, though of course no sound came out, and beamed at The Monk. The Monk's spirit informed The Monk that The Aspen Ghost was very satisfied with the resting place, and would show them the correct path. The Aspen Ghost sauntered off down the left path, beckoning The Monk and his spirit to follow. The Monk winked to his spirit, and followed down after The Aspen Ghost.

That evening, The Monk and his spirit had nearly reached the end of The Winding Road. They could see the glitter of the port town near the curving bay, and were both content. They swapped riddles and marched in time, happy to keep each other company. As the night fell, many of the region's fireflies filed in on either side of The Winding Road, following steadily behind The Monk and his spirit. The Monk greeted each firefly in turn, complimenting them on their fine legs and gossamer wings. The fireflies were greatful, and stuck around to keep the path well lit for The Monk. After all of the formalities had been completed, the tiniest firefly piped up to ask The Monk where he was going. The Monk smiled and told the tiniest firefly that he and his spirit had been traveling for three months along The Winding Road, hoping in time to reach his favourite noodle bar near the coast. The tiniest firefly was puzzled, and asked The Monk why on earth he had been traveling for so long just for a noodle bar. The Monk replied simply that the noodles were very good. The tiniest firefly still didn't understand, but kept silent. Just as The Monk was approaching the gates of the port town, and the fireflies had begun to flit back into the bushes and trees, the fattest firefly asked The Monk what he would do after he got his noodles. The Monk replied simply that he would return home. Then The Monk turned, and walked hand in hand with his spirit through the gate and down into the busy port town street.","20230605013949820","20220513012127065","","[[The Winding Road]] [[Hīkoi Period]] [[📜 myths and stories]]","text/x-markdown"

"Time Given To Flesh","***[[Date: pc-∞|Passage Consideration]]***

Dark and silent had been the [[shores|The Shore]] of time as of late. Almost as silent as the waves, a figure passed by. Moving from one deep and far place to another, this shade soundlessly left its footprints in the sands of seconds, minutes, hours, years, and even eons.

Though swift was its passage, the sand under its path was not left untouched. From the footprints and disturbances of its dragging cloak, the grains of time’s past and future were swirled and excited. Dusk and minuscule particles that clung to the hooded figure from its travels fell from it as it marched, and mingled with the dark sand.

From the instant that they touched the ground, they sprung forth with breath, growth, and blood. Time was given to flesh, and life was born.

As flesh found form in this age of awakening, the breath of [[The Astral Walker]] still passed upon shores of both rising waves and shifting crude sands, and life found purpose in following a path it would forever dream to walk. Life, in its first steps, marched onward towards the remnants of a maker with no name. An era before titles could be graciously given, instead were earned; Time, and a great store of it, would pass before any such gift found a bearer.

Minutes may have passed, or millennia. As equally great are they in their capability for change. No matter the span, in this beginning, the shambling remnants of a greater shade tread in the only direction of comprehension; Forward. As they walked with each shuttered step, unbeknownst to them, they left a trace of self behind in the frigid and misted lands of darkness they travelled, unaware of their own imitation of the fleeting figure they pursued.

Their own breath graced the mounds of what would be the first glades, and became the delicate dews that would feed fields of grass to be; Grown from the follicle of skin. Their footpaths would carve canyons, small and dainty in birth, but in blind repetition of retraced steps becoming monstrously grand. With weak frames and tender bodies, skin cracked as they wandered and the ichor that poured fed life to the oceans they passed. Oceans that claimed this fogged land before any, were devoid of life, and became graced anew. These waters instead imitated the lapping of time, and with newfound vigour, licked at new shores. Where life had walked, the waters filled their path to feed the first streams and rivers, taking claim of the shrouded land past where they had pooled for time eternal.

Life walked ever onward, until the fateful day where flesh learned of its first flaw and greatest incapability. As they dreamed and yearned to follow in the unfathomable steps of this great cloaked wanderer, found themselves at journeys end, in the footholds of where it had begun. Flesh, unlike the bestower of mystic life, could not pass through the wake of time and fold of space; Held firm to the material remains of passing footprint and fallen debris.

And so Life sank, exhausted into the shallow pools and young glades which it had in turn borne. Unable to move further, but now forever bonded to an ideal of pursuit, they and their kin settled into their creations and dreamed. They dreamed that the newly founded oases and pinpoints of life would grow tenfold, overwhelming and overshadowing the ever-shifting sands of time. And so they did.

Their children, and their childrens’ children grew and died in an instant, and creation was flung and strewn arc-like across the blind eternities. Footsteps left either by the passage of some primal walker, or the tread of its original pursuers, provided ample resting places for drifting creation to land. Eventually in isolation, in each place where an ancient footstep had fallen, great worlds arose to make pinpricks of light against the breaking of the shores of time. To the first of the Awakened Gods, these growths seemed to rise and fade in matters of seconds, and minutes. Though perhaps it was far longer, as their descendants, who now inhabited these worlds were unrecognizable to them, and offered sacrifice and worship to their ancient ancestors.

Through the instantaneous eons, the far-flung ancestors of those first [[Claster]] may have forgotten their histories and the settlements of their foreparents, though they never lost their drive and reckless need to follow some nameless goal. Through time this goal would be given many names; survival, progress, religion, love. But in the hearts and minds of all [[Descendant Beings|🧑 races]], their hunger for such an ungraspable ideal would never be sated. So it was, and so it shall be, until the great storms of the ocean of moments overwhelms us all.

"Veyeimall In Thought","***[[Date: pc-∞|Passage Consideration]]***

[[Veyeimall|Claster Veyeimall]] was waiting on the Shores of Time.

They had been sitting, contemplative, for some time now. While their comrades, other beings on [[the shore|The Shore]] had stood and rose to follow the shore, Veyeimall had waited and wondered. For, unlike their contemporaries, they were conflicted. Troubling and puzzling thoughts had come to them as a result of a swirling interior turmoil of emotion. They wanted to follow their kin; to take in the beauties of life and of being, but for some reason or another, they simply couldn't bring themselves to do so. Too many distracting feelings, too many worries, too many distracting things right here and now. And so Veyeimall waited. And sat. And thought.

In time, they grew weary, burdened down by so many multiplying emotions. They sagged their head, and let out a deep breath, letting it wash out to sea. It wasn't too long before a small figure started to wade back in with the rising tide. It had been given life by the breath, and given time to grow. Veyeimall reached down into the sandy shore and carefully scooped up the small creature. The tiny thing, no bigger than Veyeimall's own thumb, steadied itself as it rose. When they had lifted it up nearly to chest level, they stopped, and stared curiously down at it. And so Wrath spoke:

""I know what ails you, but I won't tell you."" said Wrath, gnawing furiously at Veyeimall's cuticles.

""Why not? Tell me at once pest!"" they thundered.

The small one merely scampered about all over the comparatively large palm, poking, slashing, writhing at it. Veyeimall scoffed furiously, and at once devoured the small being, chewing with satisfaction. With a singular gulp, they swallowed. But the tiny meal was far from satisfactory, and Veyeimall was left more confused than ever. They had thought that by devouring Wrath that they might in turn be filled with sudden purpose and vigor. This was apparently not the case. Shaken by this unsatisfactory turn of events and the unsightly deed that they had just committed, Veyeimall's eyes drooped, their toes curled, and their body wracked with great sobs. One particularly large tear fell to the sand, directly beside where they were sitting. It seeped into the shore, and mingled with the waves as they lapped. In time, in the place where the droplet had landed, another small form began to appear. It pulled itself up from under the wet sand, and stood huddled and shivering. Veyeimall, taking sudden notice of the new being, moved their hand and held it above the creature so that no further drops would fall and possibly hit it. And so Grief spoke:

""I know what ails you, but I won't tell you.""

""You won't? What is it with you small ones and your riddles?"" they croaked. They had stopped crying by now, but still sat melancholically.

Grief merely stared up, struggling to find any more words. It wavered, and toppled over, its small form crumpling on the shore. Veyeimall pitied the tiny one, and so in the hopes of alleviating some of its pain, reached down and picked it up by the arm. They lowered Grief into their mouth and swallowed without chewing. Grief did not taste as good as Wrath had. Now alone again, they leaned back and stretched, shuddering and lying still. As they sat in the sand, quiet and confused, something small and wriggling tumbled out from the hair atop their head. It rolled down their brow, bounced of their nose, and fell flat on Veyeimall's forearm. Too stunned to move or speak, Veyeimall peered down at this next new arrival. It slowly pulled itself up, and began prancing along the forearm. And so Jubilation spoke:

""I know what ails you, but I won't tell you.""

""I am beginning to expect this. And yet the more of you that I speak to, the less I understand.""

Jubilation merely jumped and twirled about on Veyeimall's arm. The small thing nearly lost its balance once or twice, but quickly righted itself. After some time, it collapsed exhausted into the nearest palm. Veyeimall, sensing the oncoming and uncomfortable pattern shrugged slightly, and smooshed the tiny being between their palms. They quickly ate what remained there. Jubilation tasted horrible, and they were quite taken aback at how awful it was. Tired now from all the ruckus and riddles, they closed their eyes and leaned back to lie along the shore for a while. It had not been but a moment after Veyeimall's eyes closed when they felt a flittering gust tumble all about them. The breeze wafted and trembled in the air, and all at once faded. Opening their eyes ever so slowly, they spied once again a small being. This time it was seated cross-legged and arms outstretched, square in the middle of their chest. Veyeimall was surprised, but didn't move, worried that they might disturb the seated creature. And so Love spoke:

""I know what ails you, but I won't tell you.""

""I still don't understand what you mean to say. The more answers I seek, the more questions arise. I am tired, and I am empty. But, after at all, I think that that's okay. I've learned more sitting here in thought than I would have if I started following my kin. I'm grateful that I stayed. And I thank you."" they said.

Ever so gently, Veyeimall scooped the fragile seated figure up into their palm, and ate it whole. Love was tough, and extremely hard to digest. It tasted the absolute worst of all, and nearly made Veyeimall sick. Despite all of this, it was the best meal that Veyeimall had ever eaten, and would soon become their favourite food. They sat thinking for a little while longer before finally, ever-so-slowly, getting up and starting to stumble along the shore.","20230605013858203","20220512010043326","","[[📜 myths and stories]] [[⚫ The Sparce]] [[🔒 private]] [[The Awakening of the Gods]] [[The Shore]]","text/x-markdown"

## **Godly description**
The true godly earner of plains-wise majesty. It is said that Voquev Eppenwol initially rejected their entitled deity forms, choosing instead to walk their domain, and earn their right. The legend continues to proclaim that they walked for six-hundred and eighty-nine afternoons and pleasant evenings, the same time that it takes for the soul of a rabbit to depart its warren after death. After this long journey, they sat in contemplation for two-thirds of one second, and decided to accept the mantle after all. It is for this reason that they are greatly respected.

Great masses of worshipers, scholars, and consorts followed Voquev Eppenwol during their voyage. These would eventually become great beasts and grasses as they also joined into the realm cloak. Three wood nymphs stay by the god's side however, and these would become the first protectors of the hidden Valley Circles. Though, that is a story for another time.

## **Physical description**
As they were passing along their journey, they plucked daisy-flowers, coyote's feet, and pine grass from the ground underneath them. With these (and other) treasures, they enshrouded themselves in a great and living cloak of the realm. As they passed, the cloak's train picked up more and more, and eventually became a part of the land itself. It has never since been separated.

"Voquev Thimdeit","## **God of:** The present

## **Godly description**
A constantly shifting, and unbelievably spontaneous being. More of an intelligent manifestation of the fleeting moments of thought and movement than a personal entity themselves. As the chaotic and barely organized lord of current happenings, they help to coerce the flow of time along in their own way. However, their shortcomings are often noted by their sibling, [[Voquev Yurahh]] long after they have occurred. Curiously, Voquev Thimdeit is quite popular among mortal beings, being one of the more well-known of the [[Following Gods|Voquev]]. They have been known to try to establish contact with their supporters, worshipers, and believers on a regular basis, but often find them centuries-long dead, having been forgotten about in the neverending to-do list of the god of The Present.

Worshippers of Voquev Thimdeit join congregations either by force, or based on religious epiphany. Their godly children are multitudinous, each representing various stages of formation, deliberation, and conclusion of thought. Though they are often mistaken for the children of [[Voquev Yurahh]] and [[Voquev Opeqte]]. This is perhaps correct, though difficult to prove.

## **Physical description**
Though rarely appearing in mythos, history, or any relevant discussion, they are known to manifest themselves quite compulsively at events of great importance. In such times, they often apparate in immutable and unchanging forms. Solid cubes of pure diamond, hairless and eyeless humanoids, and manifestations of pure idea are favourites.

"Voquev Yinsenvanyr","## **God of:** Insentience

## **Godly description**
The stillborn child to some unknown Awakened Claster god. For all intents and purposes, unthinking and unknowing. Yet still godly, and still immensely destructive. Their duties consist of caring for all non-sapient life (of which there is very little), and nearly everything else that is in fact of material form. They never speak, and it is widely thought that they do not know how. They have supplied and certified *many* conquests, though most are unknown to popular literature.

Being born from an unknown god, their relations do not spread far. Their twin sibling and God Of Sentience, Voquev Vivanyr, will often proclaim that two are uncle and aunt (interchangeably) to all that takes form, though Voquev Yinsenvanyr will often proclaim the specific opposite. They give no gifts, yet lend their power out in seemingly algorithmically random fashions.

## **Physical description**
Almost always, they present with no form, and simply take presence in impresence. When forced to settle into euclidian mantle, they are known to often take on the following forms:

- 783 motes of dust
- A broken funerary mask, only when in a jestful mood
- A sideways-flowing stream
- A small and disorganized legion of stag beetles (Editor's Note: It is a well-known fact that stag beetles have no free will.)
- A large padded boot with no laces

They move only when not being regarded, and supposedly have an eye inside of their mouth. This theory has yet to be proven (whether the eye is there, or whether they indeed have a mouth at all). Medically, they are certified to be deceased, though having barely lived in the first place, they consider it to be a minor matter.

"Voquev Zephyriah","## **God of:** Wind

## **Godly description**
The king, to many, of all swift movements and blustering gales. True monarchical presence is held by their command and care of all piercing winds and humble squawls. They are haughty and magnificent, a rarity for one as old as they. According to them, they hold dominion over great swathes of open plains and swooping canyons, though this is greatly contested by the children of [[Claster Gaiyadri]].

They preside over a large and terribly disorganized court of ventricle spirits, air elementals, and gryphonoids. Each member of their court has dominion over a small share of ownership and say in relation to Gust activities. It is said that the King themselves has never been in control of the shifting element for which they preside, though why none from the court have yet challenged Voquev Zephyriah is perhaps telling.

## **Physical description**
Contrary to popular belief, Voquev Zephyriah is fond of physical form, and rarely takes manifestation of the Wind itself. They make it well known that they rule, that is to say, they do not busy themselves with such material tasks. Pity the fool who inquires into their stunted stature and portly figure. Their booming voice and at times incomprehensibly fast movements are intimidating enough to belie a darker, more vicious side to the deity.

It is with this letter that I must immediately and forcefully tender my resignation. Despite best efforts and your ample funding, myself and our liaisons within [[Hathiyaar-Rakt Inc.]] have been unsuccessful in eradicating or permanently diverting the course of [[⛰️ Yadri]]'s [[Winding Road|The Winding Road]].

"Ytin","A minor sect of standard [[Florafolk]] culture on [[🌱 Druxe]]. While most of the plane's inhabitants participate in the tourism/luxury industry that they provide, incorporating their politics, traditions, and industry into it, some do not.

The followers of Ytin carry forward an ancient practice who's origins persist from the [[Taqadum Period]]. It is shaped by the belief that Florafolk exist not to serve (and leech from) their planar visitors, but to recuperate, heal, and enhance them physically. Naturally, Ytin practicers work closely with the [[PCMAF]] and [[MacuCo]]. Some members even undergo full symbiosis with biological life, living within them an beneficial parasites. This practice is rare, but has been kept alive for over 1,000 years.

Some scholars believe that Ytin was in fact the roots of the current service-based culture on Druxe, though this theory is highly politicized and is bound to draw criticism on the plane.","20230428142349628","20230427152717895","","Florafolk [[🌱 Druxe]] [[Taqadum Period]] [[Hīkoi Period]]","text/x-markdown"

## **Godly description**
The magister of all physical reverence, from elaborate pilgrimage statues to hand-carved wooden tokens. Often worshipped to in conjunction with other [[😇 gods]], as a matter of tradition for the use of their respective shrines.

Benevolent and generous by nature, if a bit overly curious. Appeased easily, but will become wrathful if shrines and other articles of worship are not tended to in the home.

## **Physical description**

Their gaunt and wizened prime material form is wrapped in a single strip of infant swaddling-cloth, folded 1,372 times around them. They appear most often to beggars and street children, offering them guidance to the nearest temple or prayer hall.

They have also been known to hide themselves nimbly between the air vibrations of shrine bells, and the crumbling stones of ancient monasteries, often for millennia at a time.

"Yyenwid Glied","## **God of:** Space travel

## **Godly description**
This cackling furnace-child presides wickedly over all elements of arcane and technological [[Sparce|⚫ The Sparce]] travel. Though mischievous and at times genuinely cruel, they are fond of mortal engineers, physicists, and [[Helmsperson]]s, often appearing to them in rumbling, arcane dreams.

One of the later born gods in the pantheon, Glied is young, relatively speaking. Thus they are often mocked and pitied by the other [[Yyenwid]], but revered by the [[Voquev]] for their enginuity.

## **Physical description**
Though fond of amorphous and bewitching techno-abominable visages, they can often also be seen as a small, many-armed, sooty imp wearing a distinctive head piece.","20220604173039229","20220206004927911","","Yyenwid [[😇 gods]] [[Voquev Zephyriah]]","text/x-markdown"
"Yyenwid Gotia","## **God of:** Diplomacy

## **Godly description**

God of Diplomacy, Eloquence and all of the Spoken Arts, they are rarely worshipped as a whole and more commonly in one of their many interpretations: followers of Rhetoric focus on words as weapons, ignoring truth in favour of form; followers of Concord treat oaths and agreements as sacred, holding the letter of law above all else; followers of Deals sharpen their empathy so as to impartially understand all sides of a conflict and find a universally satisfying solution, and so on.

Gotia themself is enigmatic and inscrutable, enjoying hearing interpretations of themselves more than presenting ones of their own. They will offer advice if asked about complex dealings and puzzling social entanglements, treating them as enjoyable diversions, but will grow irate if presented with cases with too easy solutions.

## **Physical description**

They mostly appear as a plump and agreeable person of indistinct gender, with an oblong head and many tongues, sitting on seven coloured cushions and covered in rich garments and garish jewels, smoking a hookah while smiling benignly on their worshippers. They are commonly found in a grand temple hall filled with monks engaged in constant sacred debate, to which they will seldom offer advice as sign of great favour.

It is said that sometimes they will appear through the bodies of particularly skilled orators, guiding their speech for a time, either as reward or punishment. This possession can be recognized by the subject’s tongue elongating and turning an unnatural, vibrant colour, resembling one of the God’s own tongues.","20230511010759024","20220206010229250","","[[😇 gods]] Yyenwid [[Voquev Etharg]]","text/x-markdown"

"Yyenwid Om'nd","## **God of:** [[Helms|🧢 ship helms]]

## **Godly description**
Lord and holy source of power for all [[🧢 ship helms]] in [[⚫ The Sparce]]. Divisive, off-putting, and inspiring, he spreads himself thin across [[🌐 The Pantry]]. Though heavily worshipped in The Sparce, his presence is only truly felt in pockets, and certainly not on the [[🌍 planes]]. The same is true of [[Yyenwid Glied]].

He is distrusted by many of the other gods, and has been known to abuse and extract those that would serve him. However this is not always the case, which leads to a common conception of the god as a herald of a new age, through which all consciousness will ascend.

## **Physical description**
Donning his distinctive blue colouration he presents himself regally at all times, from reposed sphynxes, to glittering arcanists, to thin sparks of digital information assembled in holy glyphs.

Birthed from soiled rags once worn by [[Voquev Eagur]] during the last centuries of the [[Pre-Oleald Eons]]. She oversees the art of gleaning incoming and outgoing death from mortal souls. A lonely god, isolated from their peers due to their young age, they find comfort in the bathing and purifying of the many countless lives that pass through their care. They are said to live in a small studio apartment in the heart of every living being, alongside their cousin, [[Yyenwid Ompos]].

## **Physical description**

One of the most commonly witnessed deities, they are well-known in appearance. She is worshipped as a tall maiden, with crooked back and flowing robes of stained gauze. All dirt and sickness from around her is absorbed, leaving behind a trail of the faint smell of ammonia.","20230504174357605","20220227212302525","","Yyenwid [[😇 gods]] [[Voquev Eagur]]","text/x-markdown"

## **Godly description**

A prideful lord of earthen grains, with minute power and vision all over [[🌐 The Pantry]]. He was annihilated by [[Voquev Insvaernai]], who heard his boastful cries on day. She came down from her lofty perch, and burned him from within. The heat of her fire instantly vapourized the sand in his body, turning it to glass and scattering it all around The Pantry. To this day, these [[translucent grains|Vrehma glass]] can be found in every corner of the universe, constantly being pulled towards eachother.

"Zoofolk","An umbrella term for the greatly varying types of humanoid animals that inhabit [[🐐 Aaliat]].

Zoofolk typically live between 80-100 years.
