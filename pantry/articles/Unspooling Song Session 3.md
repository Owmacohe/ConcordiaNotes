# Unspooling Song Session 3

{🔒 private,🗓️ Unspooling Song Sessions}

## Setting the scene
- They are on Yeima, one year before the events of the [Unspooling Song] ([pc4,200|passage])
  - There is a big event today, commemorating one year before the plane is completely swallowed up by [The Unspooling]
  - It is a jovial event, and members from all planes are invited
- Board room
  - All of the characters are high-ranking officials from other [planes]
    - [Alhammarret] is a Minister of Strategy envoy from [The Mortar]
    - Violet is a [Ytin] Minister of Coordination from [Druxe]
    - Caius is a Minister of Ports from [Yeima]
    - Nohr is a Minister of Health from [Fomrh]
    - Enya is a Minister of Tourism from [Reht]
  - At the head of the table is [Vehirit], who has called the meeting (presented in her erudition form of stretched skin, staples, and red wire). She asks each of them pointed questions regarding how to plan for the day's events
  - Also at the table are [Veyeimall] (half-covered in shadow, and beginning to whisper) and a nameless figure with two faces
- Some reality-breaking effects are in-place
  - The other planes can be seen from the coast of Yeima
  - Veyeimall's corpse can be see rising out of the landscape
  - Vehirit doesn't exist here, historically
  - The Unspooling can be seen overlapped slightly over everything

## [Vehirit]'s many forms
- A wall-to-wall, horizon-to-horizon spanning mass of eyes, ears, noses, mouths, and fingertips
- A chameleon-like hooded figure, blending into her surroundings
- A smooth stone pillar, rising to infinity
- A ring of eight hands, curled around each others' wrists
- The sound of tectonic plates

## Caius's reality break
- On the Yeiman planar council are two unnamed characters that need to be reformed to be Caius's parents again
- Vehirit can aid with this by modifying the sliver of [Voquev Yinsenvanyr] into a spell-weapon
  - However, doing so will remove its god-dampening abilities
  - She modifies it along many Truth-axis, but it may not hold
- If she aids him, she agrees to all terms and conditions put forth by [Copra Almorr] for favourable truths, should she get out
- **Combat relevance**: *special sword that deals bonus damage and casts a cantrip on hit*

> Stepping out, you cast you eyes down on a familiar sight. Yeima's vast outward curving landscape thunders down and out to its rim. The sky is bright with the light of nearby stars, and the wind is pleasant. A perfect day for a celebration. Further down along the spire, you can see event staff setting up shrines, parade routes, and Oleald meet-and-greet stations.

## Nearby [Oleald]
- [The Lantern-Headed God] (in an alley)
- [Profane Gyamtso] (imprisoned by [Format Svae], and being paraded around)
- [The Shell] (being pulled in by The Unspooling)
- Cuttings from [Theliel, Once That Was]
- Rows and rows and server banks comprising some Construct Oleald that was supposedly built

## Nohr's reality break
- Vehirit helps build a chain of disease-resistant, hyper infectious DNA, controllable by Nohr
- Roll Medicine check to determine effectiveness
- Vehirit is naturally also immune
- **Combat relevance**: Bonus action to send out spores. Action to gain control of up to 1d10 nearby non-hostile sentient beings. They attack as a swarm of Commoners

## Alhammarret's reality break
- In the deserts outside [Singular City] on [Krom]

> The sound is what strikes you first. Or rather, the near lack of it. Desert sands and thin winds. Krom's hardened deserts stretch out around you. Infinitely flat. Barely visible in the gloom from distant stars. Dotting the horizon are the faint outlines of wide, towering columns, clustered together here and there. Everything is blue, and sandy, and windy.

- Arthur has the choice to retire Alhammarret and bring both Blum and Wyvil back
- To do so, Veyeimall can reverse the flow of [The Flow] so that rather than reconstituting matter, it removes and stores it
- **Combat relevance**: Can now switch between Blum and Wyvil twice per combat

## Enya's reality break
- The [214th Isotoxal Comapact] can be re-written, going from mortal-written to being baked into the very fabric of reality itself
- This brings new forms of life, magic, and explicit rules for the worship of Voquev Arwa
- Enya can free herself from the confines of religious dogma by pulling from all religions
- **Combat relevance**: Every time she gives bardic inspiration, roll of the wild magic surge table

## Violet's reality break
- The Hag within Violet is about to jump ship
- Its magic is strong and primal, and letting it exit would have a high chance of being fatal
- Vehirit can draw it out, but it would be easier to make it at home by re-writing the reality of Proto-races to blend them back into modern day
- **Combat relevance**: As an action, she can touch a creature and awaken its inner [proto-race] nature. Doing so grants it one effect on its turn. Only works on each creature once per turn. See the table below:
  - **Celestials**: Grants the ability to cast **Feeblemind** once
  - **Demons**: Grants multiattack (2d10 + 5 claw) (2d8 + 5 tail w/ DC 16 STR saving throw or fall prone)
  - **Florafolk**: Grants instantaneous communication, weakness awareness, some telepathy, and +30 temp HP to target of choice
  - **Giants**: Grants 1 of the following spells: **Create or Destroy Water**, **Plant Growth**, **Wall Of Stone**, **Wall of Thorns**
  - **Humanoids**: Grants the ability to detonate one's body, taking and dealing 4d10 psychic damage in a 30ft sphere
  - **Kromacvin**: Grants the non-damaging ability to grow wings, gills, claws, hard skin, etc.
  - **Primordials**: Grants the ability to increase ALL nearby rolls by 5 and to reroll 1s. The user's turn is lost
  - **Zoofolk**: Grants doubled speed, Darkvision, +5 AC from reflexes, and the ability to see UV colours

## Splitting decision
- [Vehirit] informs them of a decision
  - To free her, they had to travel here to get to [The Fisher King]
  - By freeing her, she will remain unharmed, however [Veyeimall] will continue to awake, having been disturbed by the events. Who knows what this could cause
  - If they instead choose to try to return [Veyeimall] to death, [Vehirit]
  - They must choose between letting reality or truth run wild
- If they choose to save her, she will pour all energy into him. This will hopefully goad him into using her and their attack may shock her out of his system
- If they choose to save [Veyeimall], she will instead pull away temporarily, forcing him to rely solely on [Vehirit]. The combat may subdue his rising consciousness

## The Fisher King and Cyrille's home
- Abandoned theatre on one of the lower rims of Yeima
- On the inside, it just stops existing. Inside is an infinitely small and dense place in which reality is a single particle

> Staring inside, the image of what one might imagine would comprise the entire of their home is plastered over. Like an opaque, grainy film, the entire inside of the home has ceased to exist. No truths here. No realities. It isn't there. A grey-black emptiness twists and spaghettifies down into a singular infinitely dense point somewhere outside of your field of vision or hearing. Best not to think about it too hard.

- [The Fisher King] and Cyrille are out back
  - They will answer questions peacefully
  - They are happy
- When confronted, [The Fisher King] will ask if they are ready, then immediately wipe everything clean

## Combat
- Everyone stands upon [The Shore]

> The sound of waves, and the feeling of sand beneath your feet. The air is cold and humid, but the water is warm. Far out to the right and left of you stretches a beach. Black sand, black water, black sky. Dotted with the occasional faint star.
> 
> All around you are bodies. Some enormous in size, some only barely bigger than yourselves. The largest ones lie prone or supine, half sunken amidst the sands. Their eyelids are perpetually wakening slits. Other, smaller figures are frozen in rising or standing positions. The water washes about their ankles, and sand cakes in their eyes and ears. Finally, the smallest ones of all the figures lie dead. Crumpled, missing arms or heads, splayed out in final death throes.

- Setup
  - All around them are the awakening bodies of [Claster] gods, rising bodies of [Voquev] gods, falling bodies of [Yyenwid] gods, and uncountable amounts of dying [Oleald] gods
  - Far, far above, something dark is already thundering away
  - [Vehirit] and [Veyeimall] kneel slumped before [The Fisher King]
- Combat
  - Each round, everyone rolls a DC 16 Wisdom save. On a failure, they lose 1/4 of their current health. On a failure <= 5, they get one point of exhaustion
  - As the figh progresses, the waves of [The Shore] get progressively stormier and stormier

> As [Vehirit] pushes herself into [The Fisher King], the two tumble and fall. A mess of too many arms and faces wrench flesh from bone and possibility overrides logic. What rises is neither god nor [Demon]. Its sleek, naked form has elongated arms and legs, and the steps it takes seem to shift between where their land; between truths and lies. It's animalistic, worshipful, and dark.

  - [Vehirit]-empowered [Fisher King]: **Lich**
    - 300 HP
    - [Random Unspooling Event] occurs each round as a Lair Action

^images/unspooling/lich.png^

> [The Fisher King] reaches down, wrapping their arms around [Veyeimall]'s slumped corpse. They pull it up, and as their do, their bodies unfurl like paper. Twisting and writing into some spinning mass with far too many hands and far too many eyes. Its body is thick and many-legged, propelling the flesh tornado of a head forward. From within it writhe necks and elongated snapping jaws (seven of them).

  - [Veyeimall]-empowered [Fisher King]: **Hydra**
    - 7 heads
    - 300 HP
    - For every 40 HP lost, a random head (1d8, reroll 8) is lost and it becomes a **Giant Crocodile** with 20 HP
    - Legendary action to grant a head advantage to hit (2x / round)

^images/unspooling/hydra.png^
^images/unspooling/giant_crocodile.png^

> As the last wave rises and falls over your heads, the undertow is finally too strong to withstand. The Shores of Time wash away all, taking with them your bodies, the statues scattered on The Shore, and even the sky above.

## Epilogue ([Veyeimall In Thought])

## Character wraps

> For a time, you are adrift. Truth, reality, form, and perception flow in an out of you. The gentle tug of a passing starship, or perhaps a hand upon your shoulder guide you forth. [Vehirit]/[Veyeimall]'s body shepherds you home, like a deep-[Sparce] escape pod. Or perhaps a chrysalis.

- If truth remains unshackled:
  - Truth 'storms'
  - More individuals rising to power
  - More [Oleald]s
  - New planes
- If reality remains unshackled:
  - Fundamental and integral changes to the natures of races, planes, and perception
  - Beings or planes from divergent concepts of perception bleeding into [The Pantry]
- "Are there any final messages you'd like to convey to the members of your party?"
- What do they plan to do, going forward?
