# 😇 gods

{🌐 The Pantry,🧑 races}

Gods have a very strong presence throughout [🌐 The Pantry]. Many lineages that descend from them, and their demi-god grandchildren still roam and rule. Though multitudinous and with many varied myths, the gods are still fundamentally other, alien. Gods have many forms and are worshipped in many different ways, by many different peoples. Whether this is an actual representation of the god itself duplicating, or an effect of culture, none know.

Though the [Voquev] are the primary deities of reverence, many minor [Yyenwid] are also worshipped, though in more specialized and less-public fashions. Even more so, the [Oleald] are made up by the many powerful grandchildren upon grandchildren of the Yyenwid.
