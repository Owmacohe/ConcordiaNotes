# Regiment 7

{🤝 organizations,The Sparcian Commonwealth,⚫ The Sparce,⭕ outer ring,🔒 private,Hīkoi Period,👥 cultures}

A splinter faction of [The Sparcian Commonwealth], which diverged some time ago due to internal political struggle and disagreement, which eventually amounted to violence. A small, but piously devoted fleet of soldiers and pilots who operate mainly in the further reaches of [Flow|🌌 The Flow]-less space. They hold true to militant interpretations of anti-[Convoke|The Planar Convoke] sentiment and The [The Starship Charter].

Some speculate that the original overseers of Regiment 7's splintering was planted and coordinated by The Planar Convoke in order to cause in-fighting. While plausible, these rumours have yet to be confirmed.
