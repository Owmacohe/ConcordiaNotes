***[Date: ~pc1,400|Passage Consideration]***

Dear esteemed emperor [Wyeku Aum] of the 16th [Dalha Empire],

Please be advised thus by The High and Exalted [Foretellers Enclave|The Foretellers Enclave] of the [Kromacvin] Citadel: Our preeminent benders of the [Opeqte|Voquev Opeqte] have stumbled upon a dire issue regarding the Grand Pestle connecting [‚è≥ Krom] and [The Mortar] for some time now. In 617 years, an advanced case of void necrosis will have taken hold of the Door, and will have reduced it to nearly 23% capacity. The exact details of this event are not clear even to our [Singular Foreteller|Cyr, Singular Foreteller], though the probability for this case is approaching an eventuality. Please make haste to remedy this issue at once, lest the situation grow beyond mortal control.

The High and Exalted Foretellers Enclave realizes the Dalha Empire's reluctance to perform such duties, seeing as your life-spans are greatly reduced when compared to that of the Kromacvin. However, The Enclave wishes to extend a hand of diplomacy in regard to such an urgent matter. This issue affects not only our people, but also threatens trade, and the free flow of information between worlds.

Your response is awaited with fervor.

Signed, The High and Exalted Foretellers Enclave, 8th District, [Singular City], Krom

*Editor's Note: After receiving this letter from the Kromacvin Foretellers, it is said that the human Emperor Wyeku Aum flew into a bloody rage right in his own letter-opening palace. His opinion of the message (that it was in fact an utterance of great offence) caused him to incite a Grand Inquisition against the people of Krom. The Dalha Empire suffered great losses because of this, and was even temporarily dissolved due to internal conflict. Furthermore, it is speculated that the masses of troops that were sent across the Grand Pestle between the two worlds greatly furthered its state of void necrosis. No such further letters of this kind have since been sent by the Kromacvin.*
