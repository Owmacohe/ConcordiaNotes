A loose collection of united [Re-materialized|Flow Re-materialization] workers and squadron leaders from [The Sparcian Commonwealth]. Acting essentially as a union for Re-materialized individuals *(aka ReMats)* within the Commonwealth, they broker compensation deals, fight for rights, and promote culture.

The RMPF is lead by a council of 4 individuals, each from one of the 4 [üó∫Ô∏è provinces].

However, with their sights set on liberation for all ReMat peoples from what they consider indentured servitude to the Commonwealth, the RMPF often collaborated with other social justice groups throughout The Sparce. While comparatively small and new, their reach is as wide as the Commonwealth's.

Under the table, they have been known to strike deals with organizations such as [Regiment 7] and even [The Planar Convoke].
