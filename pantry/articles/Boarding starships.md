# Boarding starships

{ðŸ›‘ rules}

Boarding occurs after a [ship|ðŸš€ starships] has been reduced to 0 HP. Enemy vessels can attach to it and begin to pierce its hull. After some time (5s / ship AC point), the hull will be breached, and enemies can enter the ship. Regular combat then ensues.

[The Starship Charter] decrees that all ships, once stalled, *must* be boarded if the intent is to kill/incapacitate the crew, instead of merely blasting the stalled ship. This is both an effort to level [Sparce|âš« The Sparce] warfare, but also to not waste valuable, repairable ships. There are, of course, those who don't follow this rule, but they are universally shunned.
