## **Timeline**

### **Crew awakens**
- They had all previously congregated on a distribution warehouse in the [🔴 inner ring], where they were smuggled into shipping boxes bound for [⚖️ Balx]
   - They're going to meet with a contact, the local union boss, that [C. A.|Copra Almorr] had arranged. They need to meet him in the wildlife import section of the port on [Iera]

> After some hours of transport, during which some of you may have dozed, and some may have just listened, the cargo ship carrying you finally comes to a halt. Over the next 15-20 minutes or so, you can hear dock workers unloading packages around you. After a while though, a small whistle can be heard off in the distance, and footsteps lead away from you, off the ship. You're alone.

- They were each shipped in a different box
   - [Svae Tsering] has been shipped with dried tinctures make of crushed snakeskin
   - [Harrison Simpleman] has been shipped with wild medicinal herbs that make you sneeze
   - [Tavalath Lightoath] has been shipped with enclosed firecrackers
   - [Ribley] has been shipped with kids toy Demon-In-A-Box
- Strength checks to open up the boxes (DC 13 Strength)
- Find themselves inside a large receiving bay on the back of a [Dugong] in [Iera]
- Items around of interest:
   - [Pilgrim Droid rack|Autonomous Pilgrim Droids]
   - [Stolen Eagur|The Art of Stolen Eagur] anvils and picks
   - [🪨 Remora] shipments
   - Rations
   - Exotic fruits from [🌱 Druxe]
   - Music boxes from [❤️ Yeima]
   - Clothing from [🐐 Aaliat]

### **Making it through the port**

- First stealth check to make it out of the bay *(group DC 10-12)*
- While sneaking though they may hear some of the following:
   - That corporate pressure has been on them lately, what with union negotiations coming up, but that it's unusually marked by their physical presence
   - A squabble between two dock workers, due to the fact that one of them stole one of the exotic fruits
   - A lone worker stocking shelves, humming a tune that isn't too different from tunes heard of in the other [Balx Formats|The Balx Formats]
- Second stealth check to make it though the port *(group DC 14+)*
   - If they're found, they'll be quickly surrounded (see below)
- If they make it to the wildlife import section, their contact (the union boss) will give them amnesty
   - He will be waiting among various humanely-sedated [Sparce Cows], each in a [helm|🧢 ship helms] space

### **Being apprehended**

- If they're surrounded, they can try deescalating
   - Bribery or persuasion might work
   - Intimidation won't
- Interrogated on the spot by a cleric of the local [Sainthood]
   - She is tall, thin, and worships [Voquev Tieraal]
   - She casts Mold Earth to curve the ground in around them
   - She is smart and will listen to reason, but is fiercely dogmatic

> You feel a vibration beneath your feet, and the worn stone of the flat dockside seems to turn to sand. It curls up around you, forming into angled geometries. It points inward, keeping you from going further.

- If they continue to cause problems, or are deemed untrustworthy, they get locked up in quarantine (luminous curtains of light)
   - *Duergar (pg. 122)*
   - *Earth Elemental (pg. 124)*
   - Brought to separate rooms
   - They are questioned regarding their names, how they got there, and whether they are being paid well by the bosses
   - The Primordials in the group are particularly drilled
- Eventually they are released by the union boss
   - He gives them amnesty by offering them diplomatic passes
   - He cautions them not to do anything undiplomatic

### **The union meeting**

- Exposition regarding current state of affairs in labour
   - Due payments
   - Production schedule overview
      - The new [Mortar|The Mortar] causeways are going well, and will ship out soon
      - Increased contractor presence, so an encouragement to be on best behaviour
      - Negations with the government are also coming up
      - A delegation of transfer students from [⛰️ Yadri] will be coming in a couple months
- Note about the coming disc collision in 18 days
   - Fortifying battlements
   - Giving time for non-soldiers to move below ground
- Giving the party time to speak and ask questions
   - They explain that [The Central Archive] is folded like a folded paper sculpture
   - The further you get to the centre, the more difficult it is to work your way out. [Prognost Caradil Yun] will be nestled deep inside
   - It exists as a [demi plane|🌑 demi planes], wrapped impenetrably between the folds of  [🌌 The Flow]
   - The only way to get inside unwanted is through the use of a [False Key|False Keys], as it can open that which has no lock
   - The archives inside are limitless. Even [The Hinengaro Registry] isn't fully aware of how expansive it may fold open
   - To traverse within, one needs be well-versed in spatial folding. Without that, one can spend infinite eons walking the halls of the archive

### **Impending disc collision**

> As the workers are explaining this to you, far-off shouts can be heard from outside the warehouse. They continue, when suddenly, a door near the far end bangs open. A young Primordial boy, barges through, nearly toppling over. In through the door behind him blows hot air, and with it sand. It swirls viciously out along the floor. The boy is wide-eyed and panting. He says ""It's ahead of schedule. Riah is colliding! NOW!""

- Messenger barges in saying that [Riah] will be colliding ahead of schedule
   - [Format Riah] is taking advantage of [Iera]'s natural gravitational pull
   - All scatter
- The union boss tells them to go to the docks, and take a ship
   - They need to get off before chaos breaks loose
   - They are to meet Tsomo at the docks (an old retired worker)

### **Confrontation with Hinengaro representatives**

- Some Hinengaro Registrars are waiting for them
   - They had been stationed here to keep an eye on the union
- If the party resists, combat ensues
   - *2x Cult Fanatic (pg. 345) (20 HP each)*
   - Will only cast *Shield of Faith* or *Hold Person*
   - Each have a *Quarterstaff (1d6 blud.)* that causes *DC 12 
CON saving throws* to resist being knocked out (immune on success)
   - The retired dock workers cheer them on
- Otherwise, they will be taken into custody within the archive's holding chambers

## **NPCs**
- [Kechok]
- [Sainthood] representative
   - Dorjee
   - she/her
   - Magus
   - Tight-lipped, but respectful
- 2-3 [Primorial|Primordials] dock workers
   - Yudron, a packager
   - Cheozom, a crane mage

## **Nearby happenings**
- A package is being searched for unstable [🪨 Remora]
- A family is desperately trying to pack in preparation for the upcoming collision
- A small militia is training
- A new town is being collectively raised outside the port
- A group of old union workers sits and watches the work get done. They are continually fed, and enormously respected
