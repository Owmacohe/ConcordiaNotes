# Bayartype

{Constructs,Taqadum Period,HÄ«koi Period,ðŸ”§ technology}

The chemical process upon which light is exposed to sensitive and very thin metallic sheets. Thin enough to be bound into books or plastered on walls, Bayartypes are a common form of image reproduction alongside magical illusions and physical artistry. Bayartypes can be arcanely infused, causing their contents to move on their own will within their frame, perhaps to unsettling or heart-warming effect.

The process was originally pioneered by a former slave [Construct|Constructs] operating near to a star, who found images reflected through light when shone inside of their chassis. It would not be many years until the relinquishment of Construct labour that the technology could thrive and spread in [pc2,423|Passage Consideration].
