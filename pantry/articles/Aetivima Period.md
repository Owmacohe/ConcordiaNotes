# Aetivima Period

{🕰️ time periods}

***[Start date: pc1 (length: 2,300 years)|Passage Consideration]***

A long stretch of unparalleled chaos and lack of regulation in [🌐 The Pantry] that occurred eons ago.

Initially, the birth of the [Oleald] and the [Descendant Beings|🧑 races] was celebrated. Foretold by [Voquev Opeqte], the [😇 gods] saw their grandchildren grow beyond measure. Their happenstantial existence was proliferated to all places in [🌐 The Pantry] and on the [🌍 planes].

This optimism was short-lived however. In time, vocal minority voices of those seeking [war|Yyenwid Truge] and [annihilation|Voquev Yinsenvanyr] began to sway masses of the mortal peoples. Democracy, mutual aid, and compassion were silenced in the breaths of the majority of the other mortals. For many thousands of years, this period of regression saw the gods turn from the physical world.

It took many hundreds of revolutions, culture wars, and honest love (see the [Taqadum Period]) to champion the original ideals of the god majority, and is the reason today that such democratic values are so strongly protected in The Pantry today.
