# !CatcheKäPlay!

{🏢 companies,Hīkoi Period,🌱 Druxe}

A newly-founded company based out of [🌱 Druxe] that sells access tokens to its ""[Sparce|⚫ The Sparce]-wide cache game"". Its caches are hidden in many public places on [Bhava] and [Soetanto] [🌍 planes]. Each cache leads to the next (with a monetary price each time of course), eventually leading back to [🌱 Druxe].

The inter-planar event has been widely criticized for its manipulative tendencies, and is currently under investigation by a [Planar Convoke|The Planar Convoke] tribunal. Furthermore, the developers of the game are known to have been in collaboration with [The Sodality of Miasma] prior to their involvement. This factor is one of the major legal focuses by the tribunal.
