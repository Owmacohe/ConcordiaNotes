# The Keepers of Countenance

{Yyenwid Modsiw,The Hinengaro Registry,Hƒ´koi Period,Taqadum Period,ü§ù organizations}

A small (usually 3-5) council group of oath-sword [Pontiffs and Prognosts|Sainthood] that lead [The Hinengaro Registry]. Each member holds a single fragment/aspect of the face of [Yyenwid Modsiw] in their minds. Though the power would be too much for one individual to hold in entirely, it can be split in this between many bearers. The boons and fortune granted by these visages allow the council members to greatly aid the Registry's cause.

One adverse side effect caused by being a Keeper of Countenance is the unfortunate, slow, transformation of the face to more closely resemble that of Yyenwid Modsiw. The process can take anywhere between decades to centuries.
