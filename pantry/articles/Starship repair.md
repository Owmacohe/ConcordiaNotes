# Starship repair

{ðŸ›‘ rules}

fter being stalled or otherwise damaged, [ðŸš€ starships] can be repaired (they *must* be repaired to move if stalled). Depending on the extent of the damage, repairs may take a while, but will eventually be completed. Any members of the ship's [Engineering section] (or other mechanically-savvy crew) can make an Intelligence check to re-wire, patch, weld, or otherwise fix parts of the ship. On a successful check, a single Engineer can 'heal' the ship 50 HP / hour. On a failure, the work takes twice as long. Multiple Engineers can work the ship at the same time, speeding up the process (each roll separate checks)
