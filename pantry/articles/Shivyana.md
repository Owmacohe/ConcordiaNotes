Her great wings were hundreds of interlocked arms. Her hands were sweetly caring, and it is said her cradle calmed any man or beast. She guided [Brahmiel (Brahm)] spiritually, and otherwise was often distant to him.

Was a lover to [Vishma, the Seven Seer].

Shattered by Vishma's disappearance, and plagued by self-hatred. She left not long after.
