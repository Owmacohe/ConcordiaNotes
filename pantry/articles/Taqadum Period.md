A short span of very emotional and liberating centuries following the [Aetivima Period]. During its length, it saw the first rise of mortal democracy and social justice. The fomentations and atrocities of the past were atoned for, and new orders of civilization came about.

Its movements and core tenets were awareness of the past, strong justice for oppressors (many of which included power-zealous [Oleald]), and a credo for the future. Many new organizations and traditions came out of the newfound freedom, such as the [The Starship Charter], the [Formation of The VDC], and [🪨 Remora] decriminalization.
