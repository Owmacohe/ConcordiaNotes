### **Form**: intangible / blends into environment seamlessly

Telltale signs indicate a passage into Yadri, from a short-lived heightening of senses, to the occasional body dismorph.

The Yadri pestle does not sit within the central halls of [The Fulcrum], and instead blends into its space in many different places at once. It can be channeled into a more tangible form by strong magic, but only for a limited time, and in a semi-random location each time.
