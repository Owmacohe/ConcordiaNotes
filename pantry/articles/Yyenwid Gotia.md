# Yyenwid Gotia

{ðŸ˜‡ gods,Yyenwid,Voquev Etharg}

## **God of:** Diplomacy

## **Godly description**

God of Diplomacy, Eloquence and all of the Spoken Arts, they are rarely worshipped as a whole and more commonly in one of their many interpretations: followers of Rhetoric focus on words as weapons, ignoring truth in favour of form; followers of Concord treat oaths and agreements as sacred, holding the letter of law above all else; followers of Deals sharpen their empathy so as to impartially understand all sides of a conflict and find a universally satisfying solution, and so on.

Gotia themself is enigmatic and inscrutable, enjoying hearing interpretations of themselves more than presenting ones of their own. They will offer advice if asked about complex dealings and puzzling social entanglements, treating them as enjoyable diversions, but will grow irate if presented with cases with too easy solutions.

## **Physical description**

They mostly appear as a plump and agreeable person of indistinct gender, with an oblong head and many tongues, sitting on seven coloured cushions and covered in rich garments and garish jewels, smoking a hookah while smiling benignly on their worshippers. They are commonly found in a grand temple hall filled with monks engaged in constant sacred debate, to which they will seldom offer advice as sign of great favour.

It is said that sometimes they will appear through the bodies of particularly skilled orators, guiding their speech for a time, either as reward or punishment. This possession can be recognized by the subjectâ€™s tongue elongating and turning an unnatural, vibrant colour, resembling one of the Godâ€™s own tongues.
