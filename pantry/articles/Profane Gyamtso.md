A controversial [Primordial|Primordials] demigod, born in the contemporary era. Though born into [Format Uidi], Gyamtso voyaged beyond [⚖️ Balx] on a [PCMAF] relief mission. She experienced life outside of the plane, and determined to put an end to their race's ongoing bloodshed, returned to the plane.

Her words and dogma were so influential and dangerous to each of [The Balx Formats] that she was promptly imprisoned on [Svae] in [pc4,082|Passage Consideration]. All representations of her are strictly prohibited.
