# The Winding Road

{📍 locations,🌱 Druxe,🔒 private,Bhava}

A long, possibly enchanted strip of old worn cobblestones meandering round the outskirts of the main cities of [🌱 Druxe]. Many small towns and outposts are set up along its length, inhabited by previous vacation-goers to the plane after realizing its treachery. Over time, it has gained an almost spiritual connotation as a bulwark against the finely crafted and maintained lands nearer to the cities.
