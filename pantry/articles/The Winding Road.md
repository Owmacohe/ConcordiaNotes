# The Winding Road

{📍 locations,⛰️ Yadri,🔒 private,Bhava}

A long, possibly enchanted strip of old worn cobblestones meandering across the landscape of [⛰️ Yadri]. Many small towns and outposts are set up along its length. Over time, it has gained an almost spiritual connotation as a road used for pilgrimage, as any attempt to use it for a more 'productive' purpose has inevitably ended in economic or mechanical failure.
