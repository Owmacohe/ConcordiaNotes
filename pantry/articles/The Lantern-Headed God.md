An enigmatic and nomadic [Oleald], and a symbol of solidarity for [Sparce|âš« The Sparce] travellers with no central home. Though meetings with The Lantern-Headed God are rare, they are by no means unheard of. Accounts from all over the Sparce speak of a naked figure, sitting in the shadows of alleys, politely asking passers-by to remove the lantern from their head.

Upon removal, it is said the the remover is forever marked by the [god|ðŸ˜‡ gods], and bound to end up in their servitude in eventuality. What this servitude entails, and the ethical questions it raises are purely speculative. Apostles of such a god are rarely seen even a few months after the event.
