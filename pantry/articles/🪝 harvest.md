# 🪝 harvest

{🎛️ ship classes}

[🚀 starships] designed for the purpose of harvesting [🪨 Remora] and other deep-[sparce|⚫ The Sparce] materials. Either sneaky and under-weaponized, or massive and heavily-protected.

A common superstition among harvest-class trauler operators is the act of "paying the tax man". The practice involves jettisoning a notable amount of [🪨 Remora] cargo from their ships after their collection period has finished. This practice is in line with many leading theories about [Flow Re-materialization] and the nature of rebirth. It's both a religious and scientific procedure.
