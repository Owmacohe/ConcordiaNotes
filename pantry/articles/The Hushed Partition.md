# The Hushed Partition

*(aka The House of the Hushed Partition)*

The primary worshipping body for [Voquev Ovrionne], God of Death. Made up of widely-spread churches throughout [🌐 The Pantry], though mainly clustered around [💀 Reht]. It is a member religion of [The 214th Isotoxal Compact].

Sanctuaries of the Partition each house a reliquary; a physical scrap of their deity's body, preserved and duplicated. Though cellular duplication, the god's flesh is grown in [Sainthood]-blessed labs, then delivered to churches as needed. These relics are then carefully cultured and used to fashion clothes, amulets, weapons, and spells. Partition skin-witches are an urban legend among many on [💀 Reht]. This strange form of worship is believed by Ovrionne's followers to be a respectful and self-aware practice, literally confronting the common person with the mortality of even the [😇 gods].

The devout abhorr [Flow Re-materialization] and revivification in all its forms, going so far as to commit sanctified mass-murder wherever it is discovered. This places them in a strange quasi-legal standing, but as one of the founded members of [The 214th Isotoxal Compact], these acts can be somewhat tolerted by the broader religious community.
