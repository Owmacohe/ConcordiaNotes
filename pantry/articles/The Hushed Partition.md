# The Hushed Partition

{The 214th Isotoxal Compact,Voquev Ovrionne,Soetanto,⛪ religions,Aetivima Period,Taqadum Period,Hīkoi Period}

The primary worshipping body for [Voquev Ovrionne], God of Death. Made up of widely-spread churches throughout [🌐 The Pantry], though mainly clustered around [💀 Reht]. It is a member religion of [The 214th Isotoxal Compact].

Member sanctuaries of the Partition each house a reliquary; a physical scrap of the deity's body, preserved and duplicated. Though cellular growth and [Flow Re-materialization], the god's flesh is grown in [Sainthood]-blessed labs, then delivered to churches as needed.

This strange form of worship is believed by Ovrionne's followers to be a respectful and self-aware practice, literally confronting the common person with the mortality of even the [😇 gods].
