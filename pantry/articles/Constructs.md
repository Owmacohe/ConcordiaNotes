# Constructs

{ðŸ§‘ races,Playable races}

An artificial race created by [ðŸª¨ Remora] harvesters as a way to automate labour in an industry stretched thin. Once their harvesters realized their creations' sentience, they released them from servitude. Since then, Construct creation proliferated throughout [âš« The Sparce], and has even been adopted by planar residents, though at a far less sentient degree. Constructs are rare, but growing steadily in numbers. There in furious debate (both within their race and out) as to whether they possess souls, but the matter ultimately has no consequence.

Most constructs operate using a conjunction of both magical and technological means. Arcane power governs their logic and intelligence, but Turing-esque tape machines power their movement, strength, and agility.

Constructs, while popularized for industry use in the late [Aetivima Period], were actually in use in various prototype stages by military ventures as early as [~pc850|Passage Consideration].

Constructs typically live as long as their parts will allow them to.

*Players' note: Use the Warforged race if playing a Construct.*
