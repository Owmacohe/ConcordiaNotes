{Yyenwid Vrehma,Pre-Oleald Eons,Hīkoi Period,Taqadum Period,Aetivima Period,📜 myths and stories}

***[Date: pc-1,206,438|Passage Consideration]***

Leftover grains of glass/sand from the destruction of [Yyenwid Vrehma] by [Voquev Insvaernai]. The glass is made of many small grains, all of which are constantly and minutely attracted to each other. Large concentrations of the substance amplify this effect, which can at time be very dangerous. [Province|🗺️ provinces] governments contract [🪝 harvest] [🚀 starships] to collect and safely store Vrehma Glass so that it doesn't amass in too many large quantities. It is expect that 99% of all grains will have been collected and stored in the next 10 years. The destruction of the glass is impossible due to its [godly|😇 gods] nature.
