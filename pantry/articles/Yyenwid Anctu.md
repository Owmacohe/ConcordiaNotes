# Yyenwid Anctu

{ðŸ˜‡ gods,Yyenwid,Voquev Opeqte}

## **God of:** Shrines

## **Godly description**
The magister of all physical reverence, from elaborate pilgrimage statues to hand-carved wooden tokens. Often worshipped to in conjunction with other [ðŸ˜‡ gods], as a matter of tradition for the use of their respective shrines.

Benevolent and generous by nature, if a bit overly curious. Appeased easily, but will become wrathful if shrines and other articles of worship are not tended to in the home.

## **Physical description**

Their gaunt and wizened prime material form is wrapped in a single strip of infant swaddling-cloth, folded 1,372 times around them. They appear most often to beggars and street children, offering them guidance to the nearest temple or prayer hall.

They have also been known to hide themselves nimbly between the air vibrations of shrine bells, and the crumbling stones of ancient monasteries, often for millennia at a time.
