# Torpor spies

{The Hushed Partition,Aetivima Period}

A controversial and (to many [â›ª religions]) blasphemous act of wartime espionage involving corpses. Employed primarily during the [Aetivima Period], this tactic involved ritually killing a trained spy, and casting a latent necromantic spell upon the corpse. The body would then be floated into, dropped, or buried within enemy territory where, after a certain short time period, it would resurrect with limited consciousness to perform any necessary deeds behind combat lines.

As one might imagine, the practice was rife with illegal killings and extremely unsanitary measures, and was one of the first wartime acts banned at the start of the [Taqadum Period]. Rumours tell that the act still happens today, albeit in a much more ritualistic sense.
