- If we had to give the session a TV/film rating what would it be? (*i.e.* E, PG, R)
- Are we comfortable with possible player character death?
- Are we comfortable with secrets between players?
- How many sessions do we want to have?

***Tonal recap with unanimous approval***

## 2. **Comfort and disclaimers**
- All roleplaying games are fundamentally vulnerable activities. We act like weird kids for 3-4 hours while rolling plastic rocks. But its vulnerability is also what liberates us from the terrifying and exhausting pace of adult life. *It's good to be be goofy, lean into it.* However, if there are ever moments of discomfort, however small, you can always let me know. We'll talk it out, omit or fast-forward sections, revise histories, and adapt our own play styles to make sure that everyone is having a good time.
- Bigotry, trolling, or harassment is not allowed. This applies to both in and out of character, unless your character has a legitimately good reason to do so
- If you're ever made uncomfortable by anyone at the table or the things that happen in-game, you can always talk to me private

## 3. **Setting**
- What types of setting have people played in before? (*e.g.* high fantasy, science fiction, historical, low fantasy, etc.)
- Does the group want to use my setting?
- If yes, discuss the following:
   - Setting ethos/vibe (*i.e.* Firefly + socialism + dragons, godly influence, equity at the forefront)
   - Planes/Sparce
   - Races
   - Politics
- If yes, introduce this wiki
- If yes, do they want the campaign to take place in The Sparce, or between the planes? Do they want to have roles on a starship?
- Of no, what kind of setting do they want to play in?

## 4. **House rules**
- Milestone levelling
- [Player house rules]
- Any house rules that people don't want to use?
- I'll try almost always to never say outright no to something, however, we may need to adapt certain actions or character creation choices to something that fits the setting or narrative better

## 5. **Character creation (in no particular order)**
- Individuals
   - Mechanical aspects (*i.e.* race, class, background)
   - Personality aspects (*i.e.* bond, ideals, flaws)
   - Backstory (max one page)
   - *What is your motivation for adventuring?*
   - Tell 1-2 facts about your character (don't have to be interesting)
- Group
   - How do the characters know each other?
   - How long have they known each other?
   - What is the group motivated by? (*e.g.* salary, revenge, crisis, curse)

## 6. **Scenarios**
- One each from the 3 pillars of D&D will be chosen, and we'll meander through them to help get a feel for our characters
- This is purely non-canonical (unless we all decide that it is)
- After this, you're free to change any aspects of your characters
