## **Plane of:** Fauna

Similarly to [⚖️ Balx] or [The Mortar], Aaliat is not one world, but is instead collection of small demi-planes. Each disc-shaped plane sits stacked on top of the last, and each has its own atmosphere, local stars, and edges. Shifting slightly at all times over top of each other, each demi-plane corresponds to a particular environment conducive biological life. There are 5 demi-planes in total, each with their own sub-ecosystems and populations.

From top to bottom, the demi-planes are ordered as such: [Nerra] > [Eutsa]  > [Espoc] > [Æo] > [Laiag]
