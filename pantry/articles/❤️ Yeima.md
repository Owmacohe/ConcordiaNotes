# ‚ù§Ô∏è Yeima

{üåç planes,Soetanto}

## **Plane of:** Emotions
## **Primary lifeforms:** Demons

---

A spinning top of a world, Yeima geography is dotted with stony crags, vast fields, and deep caves. The temperature is unnaturally warm, though not for the Emotion [Demons] that live there. The plane is disc-shaped, with one large and exponentially tall spire at its centre. All roads on the world lead to the spire.

*Squat clusters of cities dot the rim of disc, between which high-speed trains flow. Rugged patches of stony cliffs and thin plains become less and less common as your eyes follow the curvature of the central spire. Brilliant towers and vertical cities cluster ever closer and taller leading up to its tip.*
