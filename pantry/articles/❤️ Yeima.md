# ‚ù§Ô∏è Yeima

{üåç planes,Soetanto}

## **Plane of:** Emotions
## **Primary lifeforms:** Demons

---

A spinning top of a world, Yeima geography is dotted with stony crags, vast fields, and deep caves. The temperature is unnaturally warm, though not for the Emotion [Demons] that live there. The plane is disc-shaped, with one large and exponentially tall spire at its centre. All roads on the world lead to the spire.

The plane's [Demonic|Demons] inhabitants are relegated to varying elevations along the length of the disc up to the spire. Each 'level' is organized, constructed, and lived in by its respective inhabitants. Naturally, lower sections have much more housing and infrastructure than the higher ones, but must also support larger populations, enforcement, and food requirements. This balance and self-governance is key to Yeiman politics.

*Squat clusters of cities dot the rim of disc, between which high-speed trains flow. Rugged patches of stony cliffs and thin plains become less and less common as your eyes follow the curvature of the central spire. Brilliant towers and vertical cities cluster ever closer and taller leading up to its tip.*
