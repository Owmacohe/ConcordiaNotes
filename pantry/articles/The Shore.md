# The Shore

{The Awakening of the Gods,Pre-Oleald Eons,🔒 private,The Astral Walker,🌌 The Flow}

The ancient name for the twisting bands and currents of [🌌 The Flow]. Along with the imprints of [The Astral Walker], it was one of the original building blocks of both [godly|😇 gods] and [mortal|🧑 races] life in [🌐 The Pantry].

During [The Awakening of the Gods] and the [Pre-Oleald Eons], The Shore 'solidified' into the geographical connotation that it has today, but was originally much more metaphysical.
