# Celestials

{üßë races,‚òÅÔ∏è Fomrh,Playable races}

The meditative, enigmatic, yet unpredictable beings native to [‚òÅÔ∏è Fomrh]. Though most are humanoid, some are far more complex in size, shape, and colouration. All Celestials sport pastel-tinted skin and a possibility of having extra mouths, arms, heads, etc. The most complex of their order resemble clusters of spinning wheels, centaur-like bodies, or even more symbolic forms. All are blind, and most don't even have eyes. Though peaceful and thoughtful, they are entirely neutral in disposition, seeing other beings' lives as somewhat inconsequential. They fancy themselves scholars and monks, but of course, many exceptions exist.

Celestials are 'born' through magical rites and specific rituals performed by other Celestials. In groups of 2-4 (or sometimes even 1), new Celestials can be created. Celestials do have the ability to procreate sexually, though not with their own kind. Any resulting children will retain traits from both parents.

Celestials typically live between 150-200 years.

*Players' note: Use the Aasimar race if playing a Celestial. You are blind, but have tremorsense up to 15ft.*
