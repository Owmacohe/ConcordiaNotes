# The Sparcian Commonwealth

{⚫ The Sparce,🤝 organizations,❗ featured articles,Hīkoi Period,👥 cultures}

A disparate but tightly-knit organization of [🚀 starships] and outposts in [⚫ The Sparce]. They represent a shared ideology of existing as a sovereign state as opposed to life on the [🌍 planes]. Militaristic and dangerous, their ranks are formed by smugglers, ex-patriots, and combat veterans. Their leadership is made up of a council of roughly 5-7 ship captains, who convene for important discussions about strategy, exploits, and negotiations.

Constantly looking to expand their ranks, they jump on opportunities to take planar colonies and vessels into their grasp. While not explicitly villainous, they have many critics, most of whom hail from the planes.

The Commonwealth is primarily made up of: [Constructs], [Demons], [Humanoids], and [Zoofolk].
