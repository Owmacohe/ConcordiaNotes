*(pron. Viveed)*

***[Date: pc2,512|Passage Consideration]***

A secret, failed plane created by the [VDC] in the early days of its [formation|Formation of The VDC]. Intended originally as a massive, paradoxically-sized warehouse rivalled only by [The Hinengaro Registry], the lack of initial interest for the Conglomerate meant that the demi-plane had to be severely scaled down. Even though the project failed, it has been cited by historians as an initial example of [Aetivima|Aetivima Period] politics slipping through the cracks into the [Hīkoi Period].
