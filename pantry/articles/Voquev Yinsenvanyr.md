# Voquev Yinsenvanyr

{ðŸ˜‡ gods,Voquev,Claster Amaaliat}

## **God of:** Insentience

## **Godly description**
The stillborn child to some unknown Awakened Claster god. For all intents and purposes, unthinking and unknowing. Yet still godly, and still immensely destructive. Their duties consist of caring for all non-sapient life (of which there is very little), and nearly everything else that is in fact of material form. They never speak, and it is widely thought that they do not know how. They have supplied and certified *many* conquests, though most are unknown to popular literature.

Being born from an unknown god, their relations do not spread far. Their twin sibling and God Of Sentience, Voquev Vivanyr, will often proclaim that two are uncle and aunt (interchangeably) to all that takes form, though Voquev Yinsenvanyr will often proclaim the specific opposite. They give no gifts, yet lend their power out in seemingly algorithmically random fashions.

## **Physical description**
Almost always, they present with no form, and simply take presence in impresence. When forced to settle into euclidian mantle, they are known to often take on the following forms:

- 783 motes of dust
- A broken funerary mask, only when in a jestful mood
- A sideways-flowing stream
- A small and disorganized legion of stag beetles (Editor's Note: It is a well-known fact that stag beetles have no free will.)
- A large padded boot with no laces

They move only when not being regarded, and supposedly have an eye inside of their mouth. This theory has yet to be proven (whether the eye is there, or whether they indeed have a mouth at all). Medically, they are certified to be deceased, though having barely lived in the first place, they consider it to be a minor matter.
