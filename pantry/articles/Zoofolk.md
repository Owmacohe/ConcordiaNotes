# Zoofolk

{🧑 races,🐐 Aaliat,Playable races}

An umbrella term for the greatly varying types of humanoid animals that inhabit [🐐 Aaliat]. Generally bipedal and warm-blooded, though many have racial attributes such as keep senses, raw strength, horns, claws, etc. Many reptilian or fish-derived animal folk find it difficult to spend long stretches on [🚀 starships], as their cold blood makes it difficult for them to stay warm on the drafty vessels.

Zoofolk typically live between 80-100 years.

*Players' note: Most bestial races fall under this category, such as Tabaxi, Lizardfolk, Aaracokra, etc.*
