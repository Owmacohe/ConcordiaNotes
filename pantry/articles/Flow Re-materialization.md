# Flow Re-materialization

{ðŸŒŒ The Flow,The Sparcian Commonwealth,ðŸ”§ technology,HÄ«koi Period}

An experimental, controversial medical procedure pioneered by scientists in [âš« The Sparce] that enables the revivification of dead beings. Its most notable feature comes from the fact that it is imprecise in its targeting, but capable over long distances.

By harvesting matter, magic, and soul material from channels in [ðŸŒŒ The Flow], subjects' bodies, clothing and personal possessions at death, and memories are brought back and reconstituted into form. Presently, the technology resides primarily in the hands of [The Sparcian Commonwealth], who use it to bring back those who may be sympathetic to their cause.
