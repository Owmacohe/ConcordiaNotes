## **Mortal aspects**

As well as gods, mortals of all [🧑 races] also contain aspects, though they're much more hidden, and more psychological. At times, these aspects can be drawn out from a being by a powerful (usually godly) force. Respectively, they represent the entity's mind, body, and soul.

### **Lustrous (mind)**

A radiant, regal aspect revealed when communing with gods or receiving godly boons. Almost gratuitous in its fanciness and impressiveness.

### **Somber (body)**

A sunken, dark aspect revealed when in places between life and death or when in times of unbelievable cruelty. Muted and sickly, but not without its own decoration.

### **Unavailing (soul)**
The most common aspect, embodied by mortals at any other time. Religious debate attempts to define more base interpretations of the aspect, such as states of self-mummification, nakedness, or hairlessness. Most are fringe beliefs, and are concentrated to scholars on [⏳ Krom] or [☁️ Fomrh].

## **Godly aspects**

[😇 gods] of all orders have different forms, which they demonstrate at different times based on certain conditions:
- Current worshipper(s)
- Location of manifestation
- Ceremony of some sort
- Godly ""age""
- Temperament/whim *(it's almost always dependant on mood)*
