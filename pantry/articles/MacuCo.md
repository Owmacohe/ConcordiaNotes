# MacuCo

{🏢 companies,Yyenwid Pha'macu,💀 Reht,🔧 technology}

A relatively recent non-for-profit business organization developed by the [💀 Reht] government to provide quick, easy, and effective medical treatments to its citizens.

MacuCo pods are large plastic and steel environments that allow the diagnosing, prescription, and treatment of patients, who undergo a stasis state when inside. The functioning of the machines is kept a close secret, with countless anti-tampering measures built into the machines.

It is known however that Reht authorities partnered beneficially with [Yyenwid Pha'macu] during the development of the project.

While the great majority of MacuCo machines reside on Reht, offshoot branches also exist on [❤️ Yeima], [🌱 Druxe], and curiously, [⛰️ Yadri] (where they were intentionally dropped from large inter-planar shipping containers).
