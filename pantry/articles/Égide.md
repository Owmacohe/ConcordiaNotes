{The ReMat Peoples' Front,Singular City,ðŸ”’ private,Crystal Ship NPCs,Kromacvin}

One of the 4 council members of [The ReMat Peoples' Front], with jurisdiction in [Zopilote]. Charismatic and honest, but with secretly very little moral compass. A 'party career' person of sorts, who plays up his [Kromacvin] heritage, even though he grew up in [âš« The Sparce].
