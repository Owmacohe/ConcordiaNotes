# Crumblekin

{ðŸ§‘ races}

A mysterious, nomadic, and extremely neutral race of short golem-like people. Though quite private by nature, they occasionally venture into more inhabited places in groups of 15-30. Peaceful, and almost friendly by nature, they are welcomed nearly anywhere. They stick primarily stick to [âš« The Sparce].

Though they have no mouths, they can speak, and appear to understand any language spoken to them. Public consensus says that they have no individual names or terribly distinct personalities. They poses one eye, which encompasses nearly half the entirety of their faces. It never blinks. Though study has been impossible, they appear to be fully formed from hard yet deformable clay. They always wear pointed hats and gowns, also made of this same clay.
