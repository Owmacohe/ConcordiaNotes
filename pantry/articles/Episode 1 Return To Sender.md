## **Timeline/scenes**

### **Returning from death**

For [Brahmiel (Brahm)]: Flat stone area, sounds of water to the left, and wind to the right. Surrounded by endless rocks of varying size. All rocks shift, twitch, and ripple when walked near to. After a few steps, one doesn't stop shaking. If approached and picked up, it crumbles into dust, which invades his sinuses and the dream ends.

For [Mule]: Deep underwater in a stormy reef. Many other bodies are intertwined in the kelp. Struggling to the surface, they see a thin strip of land and a distant mountain on the horizon. Before anything can be done, a large wave crashes over them and the dream ends.

For [Penellaphe (Pen) Astaseul]: Sharp shale ridge, with a flat valley down below, and a sea far below it. Climbing the shale and awkward passages, she makes it towards a shining and vibrating source at the top. Upon grasping it, its light blasts all that can be seen, and the dream ends.

### **Each character starts in different locations on a [Commonwealth|The Sparcian Commonwealth] ship after being [re-materialized|Flow Re-materialization]**

All awaken with small circular tattoos around the base of their necks. This is a by-product of the re-materialization.

1. In the medbay, surrounded by bodies
   - All on cots
   - Doctors don't notice at first, and are unarmed
2. In the hold, tucked away between boxes
   - Inside a flimsy box, must break to exit
   - Various weapons, medicines, archives, and [ü™® Remora]
   - Sedated and sleeping [Giant|Giants] tucked away in the very back. Covered in a tarp and well hidden
   - Sounds of footfalls up above
3. In a detached escape pod
   - Coming out of a stasis tube
   - Glass is cracked, but holding
   - First aid kit (open), rations, emergency manuals, etc. lying around

### **They each have to survive for a little while in separate ways**

1. Attended to by doctors upon awakening, and asked to help with a critical patient
   - Given stimulants and water
   - Other patient (Vhenjel, Human) starts to convulse, and a vein must be found to inject serum (Medicine DC 10 to stabilize)
2. Very small (and easy) combat encounter in an empty corridor. 2 [Regiment 7] boarding soldiers (Cultist, p. 345)
   - Just coming out of a room after searching it
   - Will give chase if ran from
3. [Flowstone|Flowstones] hidden in the cabin (Investigation DC 7 to find). Must float back to the main ship or activate an emergency beacon
   - With the Flowstone, they can kick off and bounce along through the debris towards a hole in the hull
   - If they activate a beacon, the ship's engineer shoots out a grappling hook to pull them in

### **Eventually, the cavalry arrives. They are separately brought brought to the breach**

1. Escorted by doctors
   - They were told to bring any that survived to the bridge
   - They're still very nervous, and keep a distance (dangerous procedure)
2. Meet up with Commonweath soldiers
   - [Barracuda] and [Cuttlefish] ships fly by
   - Explosions far out in space
   - Door at the end of the corridor opens, and [Dure] and soldier come through
3. Float or towed to the [Engine room] by the ship's Engineer
   - Back of ship is blown off, exposed to [‚ö´ The Sparce]
   - Must deploy the emergency shield (INT DC 12 to activate)
   - Comms are down, so they have to go to the bridge to report the change

### **They are commended for their effort by Captain [Bran Hegan]**

I understand that this is probably a strange experience for you all. Know that this was not the way I wanted to meet. But I'm so glad you were able to make it. You probably have many questions.

I'm not sure if you were aware, but you were dead. Quite handily so. No trace, as far as we could tell. Pretty much vaporized... Probably best to just say it: [Re-materialization|Flow Re-materialization] is a finnicky science. We brought you back from nothing. Our Chemists were able to synthesize minute particles of your coming through [üåå The Flow]. Through arcane and circuit, you've got a second chance.

As you're probably aware, we're not in the most stable of situations. Conflict racks us. This was the work of The Convoke. They're not so friendly off world, and they definitely don't want us shipping aid to mining colonies.

I know this is probably all a lot to handle right now, but, I have one more matter. I'd love to help get you on your way, back to picking up your lives, but I'm stretched thin as it is. I'm willing to offer you all a ship, but it comes with a job. An official one. It's not combat, I wouldn't put you to that. we have a small fleet of information gathering, purely non-political. You'd be in our employ, but free to choose which tasks you take.

### **They head off in the direction of their first mission**

- Mission: Bring critical supplies to a nearby outpost that they recently lost contact with. They were going to check it out themselves, but had been ambushed
- Given a crew: Engineers to fill out the ranks. They had also been dead, but were re-materialized shortly before the battle
- Given a [ship|The Crystal Ship]: Most of their ships were out fighting, or were being repaired. However, they had this experimental model in the hangar that they were willing to spare
- Ship tour
   - Bridge with [Median helm]
   - Grappling interface
   - Common area & private rooms
   - Engine room
   - Medbay
   - Kitchen
- Ship personality is met with and customized
   - Must be set up through the helm first
   - Given a name and other identity elements
   - Encourages others to try the helm as well

Captain Hegan allows you to stay aboard his ship for as long as you want, to recuperate and get a feel for your new environment. In time, you all settle into your various nooks and crannies, and get ready for your first voyage aboard The Crystal Ship. (Anything they want to do before leaving). When the time comes, the support structs and scaffolding holding the ship in place are removed, the Orca's bay doors are opened, and your ship slowly begins to lift. It edges out of the doors, and hangs for a moment freely suspended in [‚ö´ The Sparce], before slowly picking up speed. You glide out and away from the main ship arcing around to head a course. With your reforged hearts, a destination charted, and minds on the future, you head out into the unknown.
