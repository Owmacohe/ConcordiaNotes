## **Plane of:** Time
## **Primary lifeforms:** Kromacvin

The labyrinthine and cathedralic halls of the cities of Krom are vast and majestic. Cultivated and mastered over thousands of years of work, they stands in stark comparison with the rest of the plane. Outside of its city walls, the world stretches on infinitely in every direction, covered in a blanket of dust and low lifeless hills. All vegetation and native life (save for the [Kromacvin]) appears to have withered and died long, long ago.

*Howling winds scatter and pick up dust as they rush along the flat stone ground of the wastes. Flat horizon meets flat sky as far as the eye can see, save for a few solitary clusters of columns rising into air along the landscape. Without a proper atmosphere above, the myriad of stars seem to stare down upon you.*
