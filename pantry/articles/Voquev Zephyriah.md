# Voquev Zephyriah

{ðŸ˜‡ gods,Voquev,Claster Balxainne}

## **God of:** Wind

## **Godly description**
The king, to many, of all swift movements and blustering gales. True monarchical presence is held by their command and care of all piercing winds and humble squawls. They are haughty and magnificent, a rarity for one as old as they. According to them, they hold dominion over great swathes of open plains and swooping canyons, though this is greatly contested by the children of [Claster Gaiyadri].

They preside over a large and terribly disorganized court of ventricle spirits, air elementals, and gryphonoids. Each member of their court has dominion over a small share of ownership and say in relation to Gust activities. It is said that the King themselves has never been in control of the shifting element for which they preside, though why none from the court have yet challenged Voquev Zephyriah is perhaps telling.

## **Physical description**
Contrary to popular belief, Voquev Zephyriah is fond of physical form, and rarely takes manifestation of the Wind itself. They make it well known that they rule, that is to say, they do not busy themselves with such material tasks. Pity the fool who inquires into their stunted stature and portly figure. Their booming voice and at times incomprehensibly fast movements are intimidating enough to belie a darker, more vicious side to the deity.
