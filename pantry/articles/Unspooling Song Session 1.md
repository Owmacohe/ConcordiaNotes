# Unspooling Song Session 1

{🔒 private,🗓️ Unspooling Song Sessions}

## In the darkness of the starship
- Arthur
   - A dream about leading an army of soldiers across a glowing [Pestle|🚪 pestles]
   - Far ahead, the 'catwalk' ends in darkness and soldier are falling off it in spades
   - Behind, other soldiers are whispering, murmuring, and pointing
- Fran
   - Crumpled up on one side of the bay, strapped to a chair and sandwiched in between crates
   - A small glowing blue flower is slowly but visibly pushing itself up through the back of your hand
- Mahalia
   - Walking the aisles, checking up and making sure everyone's okay
   - You see people from all over. Mostly tourists, but some researchers, some families, some loners
   - At the back of the starship is a multifaith shrine, including a small statue of Voquev Arwa
   - How does the statue depict the god? Do you make a prayer or an offering?
- Nohr
   - Also dreaming, this time of a field of plants, heavy and drooping with large seed pods
   - In the center sits a thousand-legged entity with flowers for eyes
   - As you approach, it speaks to you, asking for you to help it grow its garden
   - Cutting off your limbs, you impale them into the ground, where they extend, unfurl, and bloom, filling the sky with pollen and humid mist
   - This is a good dream
- Cirdan
   - Looking out the window
   - Starships passing by (Lapetana Packaged Foods LLC, harvest starships, [Oarfish] luxury liners)
   - Sees one of the harvest ships attempt to get close to the spire as they enter the atmosphere
   - It gets pulled, and you can see it activiting its backup thrusters, just barely making it out of the gravitation pull of something beyond your vision

> The great spire of Yeima rises high, pulling the rest of the land up with it. Draped over and around it, like the infinite layers of some shimmering onion, or insect wing are the curtains of The Unspooling. Massive jagged crystalline tendrils wrap around the spire, and these long sheets of translucent film cover the landscape, raining down from some source above like an explosion frozen in time, and fluttering in the breeze.

## Rough landing on [❤️ Yeima]
- The starship rattles and shakes
- There's a great wrenching sound somewhere deep in the hold
- As the ship begins to pitch, biomechanical speakers sputter to life, and the pilot can be heard uttering a prayer for a smooth emergency landing. He is not afraid. This is standard procedure when near gravitational anomalies

> Glied, Furnace-Child, come down through the vents. Come down through the lymph nodes. Come down here, through this Helm. Come down and bewitch upon us an aerial descent of 15.3 degrees clockwise. Come down now, Come down.

> As these final words are uttered, everything WHUMPHs. Then again. Then a long CRSHHHHHHHHH as the starship comes to rest rather ungracefully a little ways off from the makeshift landing strips set up between various encampments and towns. A few hundred feet away, the perimeter of a large carnival begins, leading all the way up to the base of The Unspooling's curtains.

- Starship hands usher passengers off as the captain and engineers attempt to jump-start the vehicle using an exterior-Helm technique
- The starship hands ask people to please stay with your cabin groups until you reach the nearby towns on the other sid eof the carnival so no one gets lost

## Visiting the carnival

> A slow, deep shuddering and fluttering of the veils of The Unspooling occurs from time to time. And each time it does, the 'curtains' flap dangerously close to the carnival, nearby towns, and various research encampments.

### Misc
- Religion/shrines ([Operatus Captival], [The Final Next], [The Hushed Partition], and of course [The 214th Isotoxal Compact])
- Carnivals (dart games, weird rides, tents of mystery, and weird food)
- Tour groups
- Dangerous areas of strong 'truth warping' (reversed gravity, unmaking, life-creation, cube-slicing, and matter sculpting)
- Researchers ([🪨 Remora] refiners, [VDC] headhunters, and university grad students)

### Oleald visitors
- [The Lantern-Headed God] (in an alley)
- [Profane Gyamtso] (imprisoned by [Format Svae], and being paraded around)
- [The Shell] (being pulled in by The Unspooling)

### The Unspooling begins to expand
- (should happen only a little after the players have gotten settled)

> One of the curtains sloughs off, like an onion skin, and hurtles down towards you.
> 
> Up close, it rushes down and forward at an incredible pace, and SLAMs down upon you before there's even a moment's notice.
> 
> Silence. A deep fog has covered everything, and you can barely make each other out amid it.
> 
> (based on Passive Perception) You begin to make out something peculiar before you. A hand, no, hands floating disembodied in the air. New ones seem to sprout from behind the old, and grab each others' wrists. They form a simple ring. Then more unfurl out. A hole made of hands. They expand, covering the extremities of your vision and your hearing. Sensory perception fails. And what is left behind is a small figure. Frail, with long, LONG flowing black hair covering its eyes. And Voquev Vehirit stands up before you.

- [Voquev Vehirit] commandeers their bodies
   - Arthur: "It's me you've been looking for. It's always just been me."
   - Fran: "You're going to die in a few days. Make it to me, and that won't happen."
   - Cirdan: "I accept. I'm ready to deal."
   - Nohr: "I know what you want. Free me, and your word will be as truth."
   - Mahalia: "How do you know your family is real? If you want to make sure that they stay that way, you'll come aid me."

- People begin darting towards The Unspooling
- Some in groups, some individual
- They begin to come in large masses behind you, and you feel yourselves falling into line ahead of them
- Ahead, a line of people. They are armed, they are shouting, and they are refusing entrance to any that come close

## Fighting [Leyaprac, Standing Tall, Holding Fast, Unshaken]

> You're at the head of this rushing crowd, running at full speed towards a fearsome line of armoured guards and monks. Before you, the wall of soldiers cries out: "Leyaprac! Standing Tall! Holding Fast! Unshaken!". Your crowd collides with theirs, pushing, straining, reaching to get to the other side; to the Unspooling.

- Stats
   - 2x Gladiator (Leyaprac Shieldbearer)
   - 5x Bandit (Leyaprac Warden)
   - 1x Cult Fanatic (Leyaprac Fortifier)
- Leyaprac death
   - When Wardens die, they produce a 5ft wall of flesh and red crystal. All creatures within the wall take 2d8 piercing damage
   - When Shieldbearers die, they produce a 15ft wall of flesh and red crystal. All creatures within the wall take 2d12 piercing damage
   - Either can choose to spend one action to wait and explode on the next turn. Doing so doubles the range and adds 1d6 to the damage

- If at least three Leyaprac die in one round, at the end of the round everyone falls prone (see below)

> Suddenly, from below you, the ground erupts, spraying molten glass, and you feel your feet lift off into the air. You float momentarily, before being slammed back down. The ground beneath your feet crunches, now inexplicably entirely made of glass.

- At the start of each round, roll on the [Random Unspooling Events] table
