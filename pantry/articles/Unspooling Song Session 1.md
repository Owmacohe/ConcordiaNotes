# Unspooling Song Session 1

{🔒 private,🗓️ Unspooling Song Sessions}

## Rough landing on [❤️ Yeima]

## Chaos as the Unspooling begins to expand

## Within the 'Accretion Disc' / the settlements that have been consumed

### Misc
- Religion/shrines ([Operatus Captival], [The Final Next], [The Hushed Partition], and of course [The 214th Isotoxal Compact])
- Carnivals (dart games, weird rides, tents of mystery, and weird food)
- Tour groups
- Dangerous areas of strong 'truth warping' (reversed gravity, unmaking, life-creation, cube-slicing, and matter sculpting)
- Researchers ([🪨 Remora] refiners, [VDC] headhunters, and university grad students)

### Individuals with truths (drop these every 10 minutes or so)
- Love-stricken person: they and [Voquev Vehirit] would be perfect romantic partners
- Combatants: they are going to die tomorrow
- Bloody person: they have a cancer in their stomach
- Celestial: they can see now, and are completely overwhelmed by it
- Nameless person: keep losing and regaining different names

### Oleald visitors
- [The Lantern-Headed God] (in an alley)
- [Profane Gyamtso] (imprisoned by [Format Svae], and being paraded around)
- [The Shell] (being pulled in by The Unspooling)

### Visit from [Voquev Vehirit]
- They are passed over by one of the sheets of The Unspooling
- Voquev Vehirit forcefully 'commandeers' their bodies
- They are (in one way or another) compelled to come save her

## Fighting [Leyaprac, Standing Tall, Holding Fast, Unshaken]

> You're at the head of this rushing crowd, running at full speed towards a fearsome line of armoured guards and monks. Behind them, the great spire of Yeima rises, pulling the rest of the land up with it. Draped over and around it, like the infinite layers of some shimmering onion, or insect wing are the curtains of The Unspooling. Massive jagged crystalline tendrils wrap around the spire, and long sheets of translucent film cover the landscape, raining down from some source above like an explosion frozen in time. Before you, the wall of soldiers cries out: "Leyaprac! Standing Tall! Holding Fast! Unshaken!". Your crowd collides with theirs, pushing, straining, reaching to get to the other side; to the Unspooling.

> Suddenly, from below you, the ground erupts, spraying molten glass, and you feel your feet lift off into the air. You float momentarily, before being slammed back down. The ground beneath your feet crunches, now inexplicably entirely made of glass.

## Within the 'Event Horizon' / the world starts to peel back

## Getting to the 'Singularity' / final cliffhanger
