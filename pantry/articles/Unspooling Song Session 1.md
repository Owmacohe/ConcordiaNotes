# Unspooling Song Session 1

{🔒 private,🗓️ Unspooling Song Sessions}

## In the darkness of the starship
- *1-2 characters are dreaming*
- *Other characters have small duties*

## Rough landing on [❤️ Yeima]
- *Description*

## Chaos as the Unspooling begins to expand
- *Description*

## Within the 'Accretion Disc' / the settlements that have been consumed

### Visit from [Voquev Vehirit]
- They are passed over by one of the sheets of The Unspooling

> The great spire of Yeima rises high, pulling the rest of the land up with it. Draped over and around it, like the infinite layers of some shimmering onion, or insect wing are the curtains of The Unspooling. Massive jagged crystalline tendrils wrap around the spire, and long sheets of translucent film cover the landscape, raining down from some source above like an explosion frozen in time.

- They are met by Voquev Vehirit
    - *Description*
- She commandeers their bodies
    - Arthur: "It's me you've been looking for. It's always just been me."
    - Fran: "You're going to die in a few days. Make it to me, and that won't happen."
    - Cirdan: "I accept. I'm ready to deal."
    - Fiona: "I know what you want. Free me, and your word will be as truth."
    - Mahalia: "How do you know your family is real? If you want to make sure that they stay that way, you'll come aid me."

### Misc
- Religion/shrines ([Operatus Captival], [The Final Next], [The Hushed Partition], and of course [The 214th Isotoxal Compact])
- Carnivals (dart games, weird rides, tents of mystery, and weird food)
- Tour groups
- Dangerous areas of strong 'truth warping' (reversed gravity, unmaking, life-creation, cube-slicing, and matter sculpting)
- Researchers ([🪨 Remora] refiners, [VDC] headhunters, and university grad students)

### Oleald visitors
- [The Lantern-Headed God] (in an alley)
- [Profane Gyamtso] (imprisoned by [Format Svae], and being paraded around)
- [The Shell] (being pulled in by The Unspooling)

## Fighting [Leyaprac, Standing Tall, Holding Fast, Unshaken]

> You're at the head of this rushing crowd, running at full speed towards a fearsome line of armoured guards and monks. Before you, the wall of soldiers cries out: "Leyaprac! Standing Tall! Holding Fast! Unshaken!". Your crowd collides with theirs, pushing, straining, reaching to get to the other side; to the Unspooling.

- Stats
   - 2x Gladiator (Leyaprac Shieldbearer)
   - 5x Bandit (Leyaprac Warden)
   - 1x Cult Fanatic (Leyaprac Fortifier)
- Leyaprac death
   - When Wardens die, they produce a 5ft wall of flesh and red crystal. All creatures within the wall take 2d8 piercing damage
   - When Shieldbearers die, they produce a 15ft wall of flesh and red crystal. All creatures within the wall take 2d12 piercing damage
   - Either can choose to spend one action to wait and explode on the next turn. Doing so doubles the range and adds 1d6 to the damage

- If at least three Leyaprac die in one round, at the end of the round everyone falls prone (see below)

> Suddenly, from below you, the ground erupts, spraying molten glass, and you feel your feet lift off into the air. You float momentarily, before being slammed back down. The ground beneath your feet crunches, now inexplicably entirely made of glass.

## Within the 'Event Horizon' / the world starts to peel back
- *Description of the world stripping away*
- *Description of reality stripping away*

### Individuals with truths (drop these every 10 minutes or so)
- Love-stricken person: they and [Voquev Vehirit] would be perfect romantic partners
- Combatants: they are going to die tomorrow
- Bloody person: they have a cancer in their stomach
- Celestial: they can see now, and are completely overwhelmed by it
- Nameless person: keep losing and regaining different names

- They get to the great maw

## Getting to the 'Singularity' / final cliffhanger
- *Description of falling through*
