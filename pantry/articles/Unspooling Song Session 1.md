## Arrival on Yeima
- Start with dreams (arrival is pre-decided, but sleeping place is chosen by player)
   - [Als'faer en Luffen]
      - **Dream:** Lying twisted at the bottom of a pit, hands reach down from the walls. Hands retreat from his grasp, pulled up towards the light above. Once he makes it up, he realizes he's been climbing down insteas of up, and he falls, falls, falls.
      - **Arrival:** 
   - Mahalia's character
      - **Dream:** 
      - **Arrival:** By commercial transport (cramped and long, but lively)
   - Fiona's character
       - **Dream:** Grafting a dying tree onto a living one, so that it may live. New and strange blooms grow, but quickly wither, the new curling around the old, forming what looks like The Unspooling. It crumbles the pot, soil, and their hands, and the ground gives out below them.
       - **Arrival:** Descent by escape pod, far off and away from the populace
- Dreams are interrupted by reality shift (gravity shifts upside down, and various patches of land and soil turn to glass)
- All three have joined a tour group
   - [Als'faer en Luffen] keeps getting pings from inside The Unspooling, and wants to ask around about it
   - Mahalia's character ???
   - Fiona's character is looking for a way to blend in and find converts

## Discovering the surrounding encampment

### Misc (allow players to decide what to do)
- Religion/shrines ([Operatus Captival], [The Final Next], [The Hushed Partition], and of course [The 214th Isotoxal Compact])
- Carnivals (dart games, weird rides, tents of mystery, and weird food)
- Tour groups
- Dangering areas of strong 'truth warping' (reversed gravity, unmaking, life-creation, cube-slicing, and matter sculpting)

### Individuals with truths (drop these every 30 minutes or so)
- Love-stricken person: they and [Voquev Vehirit] would be perfect romantic partners
- Combatants: they are going to die tomorrow
- Bloody person: they have a cancer in their stomach
- Celestial: they can see now, and are completely overwhelmed by it
- Nameless person: keep losing and regaining different names

### Oleald visitors
- [The Lantern-Headed God] (in an alley)
- [Profane Gyamtso] (imprisoned by [Format Svae], and being paraded around)
- [The Shell] (being pulled in by The Unspooling)

## Seeing [Voquev Vehirit] (should happen halfway through)
> Between the passersby, the clatter of carts, and the blare of digitized loudspeakers, you spy something most curious. Floating, suspended a few meters off the ground are eight large disembodied hands. They curl around each other forming a loop. Within the circular space they form, there is complete darkness. And, as if you hadn't been paying attention, you hear a voice coming to you, repeating from the back of your mind. And Voquev Vehirit speaks to you.
> 
> - "Why are you here?"
> - "What are you going to do?"
> - "What do you want to change?"

## Fighting to get to The Unspooling through [Leyaprac, Standing Tall, Holding Fast, Unshaken]
- Combat and shouting breaks loose nearby as Leyaprac forces advance
- The crowd suddenly rushes toward The Unspooling, causing chaos
- A small opening can be seen, and the group makes for it
- They are stopped by a group of five soldiers, and combat happens
   - *Stat blocks*

## Getting inside The unspooling
> *Getting through*

> *The hook*
