{üîí private,üóìÔ∏è Unspooling Song Sessions}

## Trajectory
1. Big splashy arrival
2. Being thrust into the surrounding encampments
3. Glimpses of [Voquev Vehirit], with accompanying truths given
4. Slow realization that the longer they spend here, the more truths will be revealed to them
5. Fighting their way into [The Unspooling] through a throng of people trying to stop them
6. Getting past the throng and stepping forth into [The Unspooling], only to discover something terrifying to hook them for the next session

---

## Arrival on [‚ù§Ô∏è Yeima]
- Start hard and fast, as [Leyaprac, Standing Tall, Holding Fast, Unshaken] advances upon them
   - The three rush forward, having previously banded together like many of the other groups in the area
   - People have gathered into groups, trying to rush them
   - Chaos ensues, resulting in deaths, and [random events|Random Unspooling Events]

> Shouting, and the whipping of wind, and chaos rages around you. Your small group of three rushes forward with the swell of the tide of bodies pressing from behind. You're at the head of this rushing crowd, running at full speed towards a fearsome line of armoured guards and monks. Behind them, the great spire of Yeima rises, pulling the rest of the land up with it. Draped over and around it, like the infinite layers of some shimmering onion, or insect wing are the curtains of The Unspooling. Massive jagged crystalline tendrils, wrap around the spire, and long sheets of translucent film cover the landscape, raining down from some source above like an explosion frozen is time. before you, the wall of soldiers cries out: "Leyaprac! Standing Tall! Holding Fast! Unshaken!". Your crowd collides with theirs, pushing, straining, reaching to get to the other side; to the Unspooling.

- Short moment for player interaction
- Events are interrupted by a reality shift (a dying Leyaprac had infused with the wall)
    - Gravity shifts upside down, and various patches of land and soil turn to glass

> Suddenly, from below you, the ground erupts, spraying molten glass, and you feel your feet lift off into the air. You float momentarily, before being slammed back down. The ground beneath your feet crunches, now inexplicably entirely made of glass. The line of Leyaprac monks ahead of you continues to advance as people flee, successfully driven off by the explosion.

- All three had previously joined a tour group
   - [Als'faer en Luffen] keeps getting pings from inside The Unspooling, and wants to ask around about it
   - *Mahalia's character ???*
   - *Fiona's character* is looking for a way to blend in and find converts
- Everyone gets pushed back and disbands, and it becomes obvious that just a few groups rushing in isn't a good idea
   - They'll either have to get a large group together or find a sneaky way to get in

## Discovering the surrounding encampment

### Misc (allow players to decide what to do)
- Religion/shrines ([Operatus Captival], [The Final Next], [The Hushed Partition], and of course [The 214th Isotoxal Compact])
- Carnivals (dart games, weird rides, tents of mystery, and weird food)
- Tour groups
- Dangerous areas of strong 'truth warping' (reversed gravity, unmaking, life-creation, cube-slicing, and matter sculpting)
- Researchers ([ü™® Remora] refiners, [VDC] headhunters, and university grad students)

### Individuals with truths (drop these every 30 minutes or so)
- Love-stricken person: they and [Voquev Vehirit] would be perfect romantic partners
- Combatants: they are going to die tomorrow
- Bloody person: they have a cancer in their stomach
- Celestial: they can see now, and are completely overwhelmed by it
- Nameless person: keep losing and regaining different names

### Oleald visitors
- [The Lantern-Headed God] (in an alley)
- [Profane Gyamtso] (imprisoned by [Format Svae], and being paraded around)
- [The Shell] (being pulled in by The Unspooling)

## Seeing [Voquev Vehirit] (should happen halfway through)
> Between the passersby, the clatter of carts, and the blare of digitized loudspeakers, you spy something most curious. Floating, suspended a few meters off the ground are eight large disembodied hands. They curl around each other forming a loop. Within the circular space they form, there is complete darkness. And, as if you hadn't been paying attention, you hear a voice coming to you, repeating from the back of your mind. And Voquev Vehirit speaks to you.
> 
> - "Why are you here?"
> - "What are you going to do?"
> - "What do you want to change?"

## Option A: Rushing in as a large group
- Groups splinter off
   - Groups have separate initiatives
   - *Many are felled*
   - *One is victorious*
- They are left alone amidst the crowd, and are faced with five [Leyaprac, Standing Tall, Holding Fast, Unshaken]
   - *Stat blocks (when they die, they become part of the wall)*

## Option B: Sneaking in
- Stealth checks to evade the Leyaprac
   - Failure results in Option A
   - Success results in a smaller combat with three Leyaprac
