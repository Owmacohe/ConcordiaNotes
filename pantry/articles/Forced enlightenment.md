# Forced enlightenment

{The Foretellers Enclave,‚è≥ Krom,Hƒ´koi Period,üîß technology}

A particularly physically taxing meditative practice undergone by extremely devout clerics of [The Foretellers Enclave] on [‚è≥ Krom]. Through long physical training and rigorous fasting, practitioners are able to squeeze themselves into extremely small body-shaped urns and caskets, fed only through small holes near the statues' 'mouths'. Once a devotee enters a forced enlightenment statue, they are said to remain there until the intense physical and religious strain causes them to attain religious epiphany or to die.

Many of these waist-high 'living statues' can be seen throughout [Singular City] and other cities on Krom, their caretakers dutifully bringing food and water to them daily.

Many of the statues have white-grey blast marks emanating from around and inside them, marks of long-enlightened clerics who ascended beyond the space-time continuum.
