# 🧢 ship helms

{⚙️ starship technology,🔧 technology}

The powerful, bioarcane devices that provide the navigation systems for [🚀 starships]. Requiring the use of a [Helmsperson] to guide and interface with them, they provide power for the ship's engines. For every 2 hours including and after 10 hours of piloting a helm, the user receives 1 point of exhaustion.

Due to their magical properties, they tend to form subtle semi-consciousnesses of their own, and present themselves to their Helmspeople in different manners. However, they are limited by their mechanical programming, and remain loyal and procedural.
