*Editor's note:*

*The above text is a translation from the original Divine in which it was written. It describes an event that occurred in early pc4,201, during which [Voquev Vehirit] was accidentally imprisoned by a [Demon|Demons] mortal in a fishing line, just off the coast of [Yeima]. The result of which led to unimaginable damage to the entire exterior [Yeiman|Yeima] continent, as well as the first [Oleald] ascension in centuries. To this day, the plane's entire exterior coast continues to be classified as irreparable, dangerous, and incomprehensible, though many still flock to the area, drawn by the promise of Unspooled Truth, or a vengeance against it.*

*Many believe Unspooling Song to forecast the coming of a new [Period|üï∞Ô∏è time periods]. It has been said that the sedentary nature of the [Hƒ´koi Period] has come to its functional limit, and an event such as this brings with it either the promise of widespread ascension or a regression to older ways. The [Aetivima Period] is not far from the minds of the people, for good or for worse.*
