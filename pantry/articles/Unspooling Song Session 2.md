# Unspooling Song Session 2

{üîí private,üóìÔ∏è Unspooling Song Sessions}

## Each start in different parts of the ship/body
- They are performing tasks that break from truth, and are used to upkeep the ship or keep a body alive
- **Blum**
- **Violet**
- **Caius**
- **Nohr**
- **Enya**

## Making their way to each other
- They must go through the various rooms of the ship to find each other
- The Fisherman's presence is felt in each room (e.g. in artwork as a god, as an NPC, destruction left in their wake, etc.)
- *Each porthole on the ship shows a different view*
- *~10-12 rooms available*

## Encountering Voquev Vehirit and Claster Veyeimall
- In one room, instead of The Fisherman, they find the two gods
   - *They present themselves in their diminutive forms*
   - *Vehirit cradles Veyeimall, who is barely sapient, but forced into form*
- Vehirit explains the situation (in part), and that if they want to stop The Fisherman, they need to wrestle control of Veyeimall from him using the 'ship''s 'helm'
   - Vehirit has been forced into the role of Helm, and will not be able to hold back when in the Interspace

## Fight inside the Helm
- Enemies
   - Voquev Vehirit (Gynosphinx)
   - Claster Veyeimall (Androsphinx)
   - *anything else???*
- *At some point in the combat, one morphs into the other*

## 'Driving' the starship beyond reality
- *Description*
- "How does it feel to become unshackled from reality?"
