# Unspooling Song Session 2

{🔒 private,🗓️ Unspooling Song Sessions}

## Each start in different parts of the ship/body
- They are performing tasks that break from truth, and are used to upkeep the ship or keep a body alive
- If they try *really* heard, they can affect the reality of things (now that they're unshackled from truth). This means that if they (the player) try to do something, it may go their way (various luck checks to determine effectiveness)
- The lack of truth is making certain party members split a little bit

### **Violet** in **Anger room**
- In an upside-down medbay
- As violent flashes and explosions rage outside, gurneys are wheeled in, the bodies of which grow increasingly enraged
- In the stained-glass on the walls, there are portraits of [The Fisher King]
- **Note:** Violet's Hag has begun to emerge a lot more, almost as if it's being strained out of her

> You open the door, and step out, impossibly, into a corridor. It's a standard crewmember access corridor, one that could be found on any freight or harvest starship. There are doors running down either side, each with a name plate on it. There are also portholes on the opposite wall. At the far end of the corridor is a singular, unmarked door.

### **Caius** and **Enya** in **Curiosity room**
- On a loading dock, stacking boxes and filling out inventory forms
- The boxes are labelled with notes that designate different body parts from [Claster Veyeimall]
- There is a large sooty mark on one wall, remnants of where "[The Fisher King]" "ascended"
- **Note:**
  - Caius's jar cuts through false realities, reasserting truth in various ways
  - Enya's god ([Yyenwid Arwa]) may show up, chastising her for  not cleaning up the sooty mess. She appears... wrong

### **Blum** in **Apathy room**
- Monotonously shovelling great heaps of Remora into tall furnaces
- The furnace is exposed to The Sparce, as crystalline Remora figures are the ones on either side that shovel and are consumed
- At the far back of the furnace, an effigy of [The Fisher King] can be found. It is both living and dead. It is being punished, somehow
- **Note:** He may think that the surrounding figures are looking at him. This triggers flashbacks to the Primordial and [Alhammarret Aum]'s lives. WIS save to holt it together. Low roll = Alhammarrat transformation, medium roll = Wyvil transformation

### **Nohr** in **Joy room**
- In a communications hub room, with sinuous strands running in and out of ports
- The strands need to be cauterized or otherwise mended before being plugged back in
- Each time one is, joyous scenes flash in their head (receiving rejuvenation from Frubsh Gomphera -> helping wayward souls -> looking at the stars)
- **Note:** After some time, their presence is noted, and like white blood cells, all of the other operators will begin to turn on her. When this happens, [The Fisher King] emerges from the darkness on one side. They are draped in cables and plugged into the wall

## Making their way to each other
- They must go through the various rooms of the ship to find each other
- [The Fisher King]'s presence is felt in each room (e.g. in artwork as a god, as an NPC, destruction left in their wake, etc.)
- Each porthole on the ship shows a different view
  1. A view of stars. As a starship flies past in the distance, the stars billow out behind it in waves.
  2. A view out the window of a high Yeiman spire. down below, the land of the plane slopes out, then curves up high above like a dome.
  3. A stone wall.
  4. A mirror, with various objects in it not reflected in the 'real' world (light fixtures, another mirror, icons of [The Fisher King], etc.)
  5. The Mortar, but with each asteroid floating in a raging, frothing sea.
  6. A dusty, abandoned workshop, with a single Construct sitting on a shelf. It has a single blinking light.

### Jealousy room
- A large chapel, build onto the spireside on Yeima
  - Large fluttering curtains, reminiscent of the layers of The Unspooling
  - Incense burns, and birds can be heard chirping outside
- Multifaith Isotoxal church, with all of the icons removed
- At the head of the large room kneels [The Fisher King]. They are dead and desecated, draped in Sacrosanct's robes, and are kneeling with head bowed
  - Every once in a while, a member of the congregation sneaks up, cutting a piece of their flesh and scampering off with it. In the corner, the other parish members squabble for the scraps
  - The flesh regrows quickly

### Love Room
- The door opens up from a hatch on the deck of a small boat
- [The Fisher King] is there, casting their nets out into the semi-Sparce
  - They are at peace. They love their work
  - They will ask any question asked of them, but have no memory of the capturing events
- The air may be difficult to breathe for some of the party members
- After some time, something big gets caught
  - The line is reeled in, and it kicks and bucks
  - Eventually the catch stops thrashing and what is pulled up is [The Fisher King]'s own dead and bloated body
  - Covered in Remora and barnacles
- They begin to freak out, scream, and the world and scene unfurl around everyone

## Encountering Voquev Vehirit and Claster Veyeimall in Fear room
- There used to be a reality here, but Vehirit removed it

> You are now met with sudden quiet. In this 'room' there are no lights, no objects, no people. It is just floor and dull grey sky. An ambient gloomy light permeates the space, just enough to make each others' features out (like at dusk). In the centre of the room are two figures.
> 
> Voquev Vehirit is one of them. She sits cross-legged, assuming a diminutive, resolute form, crafted from ten thousand shifting grains of rice and sand. She's barely holding herself together.
> 
> In her lap lies the head of Claster Veyeimall. The rest of its body extends out before her, half dissolving into the ground. Its corpse is *crawling* with a small writhing mass. It looks to you, and tries to speak but only colours come out.

- Vehirit explains the situation
  - [The Fisher King] has snared her sway over truth, and has untethered it from reality
  - Truth =/= reality
  - They have weaponized it, and have forced Veyeimall into form
  - Veyeimall's corpse upon the shore is being brought into the stable reality
  - Vehirit has been forced into the role of Helm, and Veyeimall into the role of starship
  - If they want to stop [The Fisher King], they need to wrestle control of Veyeimall from them using the 'ship''s 'helm'
  - Vehirit will not be able to hold back when in the Interspace
- Vehirit gives them the key to the Bridge (it doesn't exist)

## Fight inside the Helm
- The party must make it to the end of the corridor and onto the Bridge
  - The party must link into the helm

> The world melts away from your eyes and ears like melting glass or streaking rain. Some of you who have flown in starships may be familiar with this sensation. For others, it's an extremely disorienting moment, before the world reasserts itself again. You're standing in what seems to be a large, empty amphitheatre. All the seats have been removed, and the whole of the room is draped in concealing white fabric. Like snow stuck to every surface, the landscape is strange and alien.

- Enemies
  - Voquev Vehirit (Gynosphinx)
  - Claster Veyeimall (Androsphinx)
- Vehirit has one legendary action to cause a [Random Unspooling Event|Random Unspooling Events]
- Veyeimall has one legendary action to for a party member to (on their turn) (d8 drop the 8):
  1. Attack one of their allies
  2. Become afraid of Veyeimall
  3. Attempt to steal an item from a party member
  4. Make no damage-dealing attack
  5. Move close to Veyeimall
  6. Begin laughing uncontrollably
  7. Protect Veyeimall for one turn

> Vehirit crumples, unspooling like thread. Her flesh expands and changes, running under the white fabric in the room. It peels back to reveal faded carpets, dusty wall sconces, and worn floorboards.
>
> Veyeimall stumbles, getting caught in the carpets and fabric. Falling against the wall, they pull down the curtains until they are completely covered in it. Their form shudders, compresses, and shrinks. All that can be seen now from beneath the sheets is a single arm and hand, mottled and purple.

## 'Driving' the starship beyond reality
- Veyeimall becomes Cyrille, [The Fisher King]'s partner
  - He is confused and asks where his love has gone
  - He is willing to listen and understand
  - He knows somehow how to act as Helm
- Party to make group INT saves to pilot the ship 
- "How does it feel to become unshackled from reality?"
