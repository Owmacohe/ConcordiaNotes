# Unspooling Song Session 2

{🔒 private,🗓️ Unspooling Song Sessions}

## Each start in different parts of the ship/body
- They are performing tasks that break from truth, and are used to upkeep the ship or keep a body alive
- If they try *really* heard, they can affect the reality of things (now that they're unshackled from truth). This means that if they (the player) try to do something, it may go their way (various luck checks to determine effectiveness)

### **Violet** in **Anger room**
- Un an upside-down medbay
- As violent flashes and explosions rage outside, gurneys are wheeled in, the bodies of which grow increasingly enraged
- In the stained glass on the walls, there are portraits of The Fisher King
- **Note:** Violet's Hag has begun to emerge a lot more, almost as if it's being strained out of her

### **Caius** and **Enya** in **Curiosity room**
- On a loading dock, stacking boxes and filling out inventory forms
- The boxes are labelled with notes that designate different body parts from [Claster Veyeimall]
- There is a large sooty mark on one wall, remnants of where "The Fisher King" "ascended"
- **Note:**
  - Caius's jar cuts through false realities, reasserting truth in various ways
  - Enya's god ([Yyenwid Arwa]) may show up, chastising her for  not cleaning up the sooty mess. She appears... wrong

### **Blum** in **Apathy room**
- Monotonously shovelling great heaps of Remora into tall furnaces
- The furnace is exposed to The Sparce, as crystalline Remora figures are the ones on either side that shovel and are consumed
- At the far back of the furnace, an effigy of The Fisher King can be found. It is both living and dead. It is being punished, somehow
- **Note:** He may think that the surrounding figures are looking at him. UThis triggers flashbacks to the Primordial and Alhammarret's lives

### **Nohr** in **Joy room**
- In a communications hub room, with sinuous strands running in and out of ports
- The strands need to be cauterized or otherwise mended before being plugged back in
- Each time one is, joyous scenes flash in their head (receiving rejuvenation from Frubsh Gomphera -> helping wayward souls -> looking at the stars)
- **Note:** After some time, their presence is noted, and like white blood cells, all of the other operators will begin to turn on her. When this happens, The Fisher King emerges from the darkness on one side. They are draped in cables and plugged into the wall

## Making their way to each other
- They must go through the various rooms of the ship to find each other
- The Fisher King's presence is felt in each room (e.g. in artwork as a god, as an NPC, destruction left in their wake, etc.)
- Each porthole on the ship shows a different view
  1. A view of stars. As a starship flies past in the distance, the stars billow out behind it in waves.
  2. A view out the window of a high Yeiman spire. down below, the land of the plane slopes out, then curves up high above like a dome.
  3. A stone wall.
  4. A mirror, with various objects in it not reflected in the 'real' world (light fixtures, another mirror, icons of The Fisher King, etc.)
  5. The Mortar, but with each asteroid floating in a raging, frothing sea.
  6. A dusty, abandoned workshop, with a single Construct sitting on a shelf. It has a single blinking light.

## Encountering Voquev Vehirit and Claster Veyeimall in Fear room
- There used to be a reality here, but Vehirit removed it

> You swing the door open, and are met with sudden quiet. In this 'room' there are no lights, no objects, no people. It is just floor and dull grey sky. An ambient gloomy light permeates the space, just enough to make each others' features out (like at dusk). In the centre of the room are two figures.
> 
> Voquev Vehirit is one of them. She sits cross-legged, assuming a diminutive, resolute form, crafted from ten thousand shifting grains of rice and sand. She's barely holding herself together.
> 
> In her lap lies the head of Claster Veyeimall. The rest of its body extends out before her, half dissolving into the ground. Its corpse is *crawling* with a small writhing mass. It looks to you, and tries to speak but only colours come out.

- Vehirit explains the situation
  - The Fisher King has snared her sway over truth, and has untethered it from reality
  - Truth =/= reality
  - They have weaponized it, and have forced Veyeimall into form
  - Veyeimall's corpse upon the shore is being brought into the stable reality
  - Vehirit has been forced into the role of Helm, and Veyeimall into the role of starship
  - If they want to stop The Fisher King, they need to wrestle control of Veyeimall from them using the 'ship''s 'helm'
  - Vehirit will not be able to hold back when in the Interspace

## Fight inside the Helm
- Enemies
  - Voquev Vehirit (Gynosphinx)
  - Claster Veyeimall (Androsphinx)
- Vehirit has one legendary action to cause a [Random Unspooling Event|Random Unspooling Events]
- Veyeimall has one legendary action to for a party member to (on their turn) (d8 drop the 8):
  1. Attack one of their allies
  2. Become afraid of Veyeimall
  3. Attempt to steal an item from a party member
  4. Make no damage-dealing attack
  5. Move close to Veyeimall
  6. Begin laughing uncontrollably
  7. Protect Veyeimall for one turn

## 'Driving' the starship beyond reality
- *Description of the helm*
- *Description of the environment*
- The original helm is still in there, and can be met after the fight
- "How does it feel to become unshackled from reality?"
