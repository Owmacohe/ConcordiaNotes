# Random Sparce encounters

{📝 lists,❔ session ideas,⚫ The Sparce,🔒 private}

1. A harmless supernova, can be watched with special windshield. 1d4 chance to trigger a chain-reaction of supernovas across the sky. If this happens, the shockwave knocks out the power for 1d4 hours.
2. A small pod of space whales pass by. On their backs are rudimentary shacks and cabins. A nomadic tribe of Air [Primordials] live upon them.
3. A hijacking drone attaches itself to the back of the ship, and begins siphoning power.
4. The [ship|🚀 starships] passes through an extremely dense cloud in [🌌 The Flow], and a crystalline [🪨 Remora] figure materializes on the hood.
5. A gaggle of small, 3-legged sea-urchin-looking creatures scuttle along the floor. Soon, it becomes apparent they are everywhere. They eat dust and hate liquid.
6. The ship must pass through an asteroid belt, manoeuvring between hurtling rocks. 2 rounds of INT saving throws from the [Helmsperson] must be made to dodge them (4d10 + 10 damage each), with a final 50/50 check if a rock has hit at least once.
7. A distress beacon pings from extremely far out past the outer ring. When visited, it appears to be a [Giant|Giants], who was accidentally flung far out away from her home
8. A very small moon is passed, upon which a short tulip [Florafolk] lives. He offers them tea. He has a few sheep and a flower garden.
9. A single shipping container is found, apparently having become detached from a [⚓ freight] ship. Inside are boxes upon boxes of godly action figures, finely-carved chopsticks, some infra-red disco balls, and exotic mango-pineapple fusion fruits.
10. The ship notices a beacon pinging from a sealed box floating in [🌌 The Flow]. It turns out to be a geocache-like repository filled with kind notices, logs, small trinkets, and a few mouldy fruits. It also contains a few sensors that can be used to find more caches.
11. A gigantic eldritch [Sparce|⚫ The Sparce] bird begins to follow the ship. It is incredibly sensitive to sound, and will attack if they move too quickly.
12. A teenage halfling castaway has attached himself to the outside of the ship, and is in the process of hacking them. He thinks he's way cooler than he actually is.
