# The Starship Charter

{âš« The Sparce,The Sparcian Commonwealth}

An informal, yet short and heavily mandated set of rules expected of [starship|ðŸš€ starships] [captains|Captain] and their [crew|ðŸ’¼ crew roles]. Formed over a long period of time in the name of democracy, justice, human rights, and a little superstition. It is enforced and believed in by most just peoples in [âš« The Sparce], but there are those who are bloodthirsty enough to ignore it.
