# Florafolk

{🌱 Druxe,🧑 races,Playable races}

As with other races in [🌐 The Pantry], Florafolk are incredibly varied. Generally, they take the forms of humanoid collections of growing roots, flowers, vines, bark, and leaves. They are not restricted necessarily by the humanoid form, but most acclimatize and become stuck in it as they grow. From small shrub-kin to towering treefolk, they are all dependant on UV light and a constant source of water to survive. While gentle and often kind, they can tend to be aloof and solitary when not around others of their kind.

Florafolk typically live between 150-200 years.

*Players' note: Use the Firbolg race if playing a large/medium Florafolk, and the Goblin race if playing a small Florafolk. However, if you want to play a different race reskinned as a Florafolk, please let me know.*
