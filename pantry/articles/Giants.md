# Giants

{🧑 races,⛰️ Yadri}

Incredibly rare, and often not naturally born, Giants hail from [⛰️ Yadri], the in-between [plane|🌍 planes]. Many aren't aware of their existence, but do learn of them if they accidentally stumble onto other planes from their own. Gentle beings with playful natures, they enjoy simple relaxation, drink, and leisure activities. Human-like in proportions, but with a third eye, located somewhere on their bodies (forehead, hand, chest, etc.). This eye never opens, save when in great danger.

Giants typically live between 200-400 years,
