## **Plane of:** Flora
## **Primary lifeforms:** Florafolk

---

A spherical world populated almost entirely by lush forest, jungle, or low vegetation. Seemingly without animal life, the plane is in fact teeming with sentience, the highest order of which are [Florafolk]. While extremely tolerant to visitors, many who arrive on the plane soon find themselves host to a plethora of parasitic fungi, root growths, or flowing buds.

*The first thing to strike you is the stillness of the ambient sound. The rustling of endless treetops carries on up to and beyond the horizon. All about dot the rising cylindrical structures of the leisure houses, formed from warped tree wood, and dotted with vines and flowers. Paths meander off here and there into the undergrowth, leading to bath pools, quiet esplanades, and meditation gardens.*
