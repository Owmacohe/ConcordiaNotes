## **God of:** Sand

## **Godly description**

A prideful lord of earthen grains, with minute power and vision all over [🌐 The Pantry]. He was annihilated by [Voquev Insvaernai], who heard his boastful cries on day. She came down from her lofty perch, and burned him from within. The heat of her fire instantly vapourized the sand in his body, turning it to glass and scattering it all around The Pantry. To this day, these [translucent grains|Vrehma glass] can be found in every corner of the universe, constantly being pulled towards eachother.
