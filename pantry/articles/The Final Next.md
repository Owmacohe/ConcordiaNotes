A small, yet respected religion comprising of those that follow a doctrine passed down, supposedly from [Yyenwid Unoccu]. Acolytes are taught of the inherent emptiness of the human body and soul, and are encouraged to make grand pilgrimages in search of vice, activity, other [â›ª religions], and philosphical greatness. They pride themselves in their desperation and quiet solitary suffering, and are often picked up by members of high class standing.
