# Primordials

{üßë races,‚öñÔ∏è Balx,Playable races}

The walking shrine-people of [‚öñÔ∏è Balx] are animated by strange elemental forces that inhabit their stones, tassels, candles, and plinths. Viciously aggressive towards elementals of other types, and brimming with raw strength. Though appearing simply to be fleshy animated altars, shrines, and graves, they are in fact very alive, and do possess souls. Most are vaguely humanoid, but with strange ornaments as described above. Some may often be mistaken for [Celestials] (or vice versa), but a quick check of demeanour often reveals the difference.

Primordials typically live between 80-100 years.

*Players' note: Use the Genasi race if playing a Primordial.*
