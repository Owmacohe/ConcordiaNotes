***[Date: pc-âˆž|Passage Consideration]***

[Veyeimall|Claster Veyeimall] was waiting on the Shores of Time.

They had been sitting, contemplative, for some time now. While their comrades, other beings on [the shore|The Shore] had stood and rose to follow the shore, Veyeimall had waited and wondered. For, unlike their contemporaries, they were conflicted. Troubling and puzzling thoughts had come to them as a result of a swirling interior turmoil of emotion. They wanted to follow their kin; to take in the beauties of life and of being, but for some reason or another, they simply couldn't bring themselves to do so. Too many distracting feelings, too many worries, too many distracting things right here and now. And so Veyeimall waited. And sat. And thought.

In time, they grew weary, burdened down by so many multiplying emotions. They sagged their head, and let out a deep breath, letting it wash out to sea. It wasn't too long before a small figure started to wade back in with the rising tide. It had been given life by the breath, and given time to grow. Veyeimall reached down into the sandy shore and carefully scooped up the small creature. The tiny thing, no bigger than Veyeimall's own thumb, steadied itself as it rose. When they had lifted it up nearly to chest level, they stopped, and stared curiously down at it. And so Wrath spoke:

"I know what ails you, but I won't tell you." said Wrath, gnawing furiously at Veyeimall's cuticles.

"Why not? Tell me at once pest!" they thundered.

The small one merely scampered about all over the comparatively large palm, poking, slashing, writhing at it. Veyeimall scoffed furiously, and at once devoured the small being, chewing with satisfaction. With a singular gulp, they swallowed. But the tiny meal was far from satisfactory, and Veyeimall was left more confused than ever. They had thought that by devouring Wrath that they might in turn be filled with sudden purpose and vigor. This was apparently not the case. Shaken by this unsatisfactory turn of events and the unsightly deed that they had just committed, Veyeimall's eyes drooped, their toes curled, and their body wracked with great sobs. One particularly large tear fell to the sand, directly beside where they were sitting. It seeped into the shore, and mingled with the waves as they lapped. In time, in the place where the droplet had landed, another small form began to appear. It pulled itself up from under the wet sand, and stood huddled and shivering. Veyeimall, taking sudden notice of the new being, moved their hand and held it above the creature so that no further drops would fall and possibly hit it. And so Grief spoke:

"I know what ails you, but I won't tell you."

"You won't? What is it with you small ones and your riddles?" they croaked. They had stopped crying by now, but still sat melancholically.

Grief merely stared up, struggling to find any more words. It wavered, and toppled over, its small form crumpling on the shore. Veyeimall pitied the tiny one, and so in the hopes of alleviating some of its pain, reached down and picked it up by the arm. They lowered Grief into their mouth and swallowed without chewing. Grief did not taste as good as Wrath had. Now alone again, they leaned back and stretched, shuddering and lying still. As they sat in the sand, quiet and confused, something small and wriggling tumbled out from the hair atop their head. It rolled down their brow, bounced of their nose, and fell flat on Veyeimall's forearm. Too stunned to move or speak, Veyeimall peered down at this next new arrival. It slowly pulled itself up, and began prancing along the forearm. And so Jubilation spoke:

"I know what ails you, but I won't tell you."

"I am beginning to expect this. And yet the more of you that I speak to, the less I understand."

Jubilation merely jumped and twirled about on Veyeimall's arm. The small thing nearly lost its balance once or twice, but quickly righted itself. After some time, it collapsed exhausted into the nearest palm. Veyeimall, sensing the oncoming and uncomfortable pattern shrugged slightly, and smooshed the tiny being between their palms. They quickly ate what remained there. Jubilation tasted horrible, and they were quite taken aback at how awful it was. Tired now from all the ruckus and riddles, they closed their eyes and leaned back to lie along the shore for a while. It had not been but a moment after Veyeimall's eyes closed when they felt a flittering gust tumble all about them. The breeze wafted and trembled in the air, and all at once faded. Opening their eyes ever so slowly, they spied once again a small being. This time it was seated cross-legged and arms outstretched, square in the middle of their chest. Veyeimall was surprised, but didn't move, worried that they might disturb the seated creature. And so Love spoke:

"I know what ails you, but I won't tell you."

"I still don't understand what you mean to say. The more answers I seek, the more questions arise. I am tired, and I am empty. But, after at all, I think that that's okay. I've learned more sitting here in thought than I would have if I started following my kin. I'm grateful that I stayed. And I thank you." they said.

Ever so gently, Veyeimall scooped the fragile seated figure up into their palm, and ate it whole. Love was tough, and extremely hard to digest. It tasted the absolute worst of all, and nearly made Veyeimall sick. Despite all of this, it was the best meal that Veyeimall had ever eaten, and would soon become their favourite food. They sat thinking for a little while longer before finally, ever-so-slowly, getting up and starting to stumble along the shore.
