{Sainthood,🧑‍🔬 figures,The Hinengaro Registry,Taqadum Period,Giants,The Keepers of Countenance,😇 gods,Oleald,Yyenwid Modsiw}

A [Giant|Giants] interim council member of [The Hinengaro Registry] during its formation in the [Taqadum Period]. Quickly rising from Magus to Sacrosanct, he was a symbol to many of the organizational power that would come to define the age.

At the time, the [😇 gods] had yet to retreat to a form of shrine and prayer based worship, and were still oft to give council in their material forms. It was through his position that Caradil was granted an audience with certain gods, posing but a single question to each, in turn. The event itself has been mysticized beyond proportion, but still hold glimmers of truth and morals.

Due to Giants' extended lifespans, Prognost Yun is still believed to be alive. If this is in fact correct, many believe that he still carries his [Mark of Countenance|The Keepers of Countenance].
