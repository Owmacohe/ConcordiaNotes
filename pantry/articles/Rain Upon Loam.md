Vashmat sat, legs bent together, on the slick stone. The rain, thick and diagonal, pelted down on the side of his face. It stung, burning with a soft warmth. Below him, underneath the dark stone shelf which protruded from the loamy soil, people fled along the fields. Though his eyes were shut, Vashmat could hear the sounds of conquest spilling along his lands ahead, coming ever closer. Though individuals rushed past on all sides, and the rain formed cold muddy puddles around his sitting form, he sat still. Face calm, with arms bent and reposed. On the air he could smell the petrichor of the sky, and marvelled at the vast beauty of his country.

One of the fleeing figures fell at his side. High up though he was on the stone outcropping, the fallen [Giant|Giants]'s eyes were nearly level with his own, its size was so large. The great being's body was broken, and it bled thick grey ichor from his nose and back. Quietly Vashmat rose, opening his eyes for the first time in three hours. The burnt rubble of his homeland now stretched beyond the horizon, and he could see similar pale fleshy fallen Giants splayed out, emanating from a central dark scorch mark upon the fields. The Giant to his left, now opening its own eyes, turned them upon Vashmat.

Wordlessly, the being twisted its broken arm, and pulled itself closer. The Giant's third eye, located in the palm of its hand was glaucomized and milky, sundered by some dark schism. It reached its hand down, and cupped it around Vashmat's thin frame. Vashmat placed his hands on the Giant's weeping blind eye, and told it of his fears and joys. The large being listened, silent and reverent as it had been when there was peace. When Vashmat was finished, the rot spreading from the crater on the land's surface had seeped and festered, turning the plains and their grasses to sullen ash.

The Giant spoke only one phrase to the boy, cradling him delicately in its palm:

""I am but sacrifice.""
