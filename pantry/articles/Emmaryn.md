## **Backstory**

I am a mushroom that took over a Drow body, and in the process of merging I've retained memories and personality traces of my host. I actually identify as her and am essentially her but 'mushroom-like'. I love being humanoid and the feeling of anthropomorphic perception interlaced with my mycelium consciousness. Emotions and sensation are fascinating to me but I don't really understand them.
