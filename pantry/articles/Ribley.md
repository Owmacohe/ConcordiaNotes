## **Backstory**

Ribley's excitement is contagious. While they might not always be able to tell you what they are so enamoured by, their enthusiam is never lost. Ribley's parents will tell you that their energy started at a young age, where her passion for the world around them was fleeting but alluring. They seemed to just disapear only to be found by their parents exploring a new skill, artifact, or just something cute. Eventually this curiousity got Ribley into trouble - though she might argue differently. On one particularily beautiful spring day, Ribley found herself in the presence of local fey who matched her enthusiasm and curiousity. Ribley disapeared for a week, and upon return regaled their family about the wonders of such a time. The stories always seem to change slightly, but it is clear that Ribley spent time in the Fey realm ( a week for their family but years for them). Ribley always mentions the circus, a group of Fey's who traveled around to different realms and cities, but no one from Ribley's family ever seems to have heard it. While some call Ribley a silly storyteller, it was undeniable the impact of the circus on their life. Ribley's back had begun to grow different fungi, none that seemed to be harmful, but magical in nature. These mushrooms seemed to give them power, allowing them to read minds, manipulate water into weapons, and even alter luck in their favour. Ribley's community was scared of their newfound power, and after ""the incident"" which led to a few injuries, they were asked to leave. Heading on their way and scared for ""the incident"", Ribley was looking for someone to take her in. They lived among the shadows, scavenged (or arguablly stole) for food, until meeting a few others that were not scared of Ribley's fey-touched life. They formed a team, and Ribley was rejuvinated with purpose. They might not know how long they stick with this robin-hood esque band, but for now they are using what they have been giving, and seeking ways to recreate the warmth of the circus they once loved. They don't want to a carny, but they loved the chaotic family it created and Ribley hopes to find that with their crew, or at least until they forget and find something else to excite them.
