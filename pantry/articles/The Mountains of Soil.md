# The Mountains of Soil

{📍 locations,💀 Reht}

A large expanse of mountainous soil deposits, clustered near [💀 Reht]'s less-inhabited southern hemisphere. The soil itself, non-native to the plane, and of seemingly mysterious origin, has existed for as long as recorded history. Excavation efforts and residency plans are perpetually at work below and above it.

The area is classified as dangerous for civilian entrance, as its soft ridges and valleys can often become destabilized and lead to suffocation.
