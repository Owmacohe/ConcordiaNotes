# Demons

{üßë races,‚ù§Ô∏è Yeima,Playable races}

Perhaps the one of the most controversial [üßë races] in the whole of [üåê The Pantry], Demons are at once tactful diplomats and raging warlords. Their plethora of subraces mirror a range of seven emotions (Love, Joy, Curiosity, Apathy, Jealousy, Fear, Anger). Demon societies are rigidly structured into hierarchies, with the ""good"" emotions always on top. While popular misconception attributes negativity to the lower castes of Demons, most are incredibly individualistic, and rely only mildly on their emotional designation. Demons are born Green coloured, but change through Yellow, Orange, Red, Purple, and finally Blue during their lifetimes.

Demons possess a strange magic quality which allows them to perceive strong emotions related to their particular subrace in individuals, but only if they have formed a ""pact"" with said person. Through innate racial magic, they must perform any request imposed upon them though such a pact (enacted only willingly), and in exchange have access to the other's emotions as discussed above.

If a Demon makes enough pacts (usually an extremely high number) with a particular being, they begin to lose their sense of self, and even corporeal form. In time, and with more pacts, their very mind and essence may take up residence inside the other's body and brain, fully immersed in emotion and thought. This ""possession"", while rare, can be extremely devastating, for both the demon and their host.

Demons typically live between 100-120 years.

*Players' note: Use the Tiefling race if playing a Demon.*
