# Skitter Waifs

{🐟 Sparce wildlife}

A race of small sea-urchin-like organisms that gather in dark places on [Sparce|⚫ The Sparce]-faring [🚀 starships]. Though sometimes shunned by more squeamish or unaccustomed travellers, Skitter Waifs in fact feed on dust and shed human skin, and make for a great natural ship cleaner.

While incredibly shy and group-dependant, some Waifs do show remarkable intelligence, though study in this regard has been limited until very recently.
