# Vishma, the Seven Seer

{The Hyacinth House,Crystal Ship NPCs,Celestials,🔒 private}

Seven eyes along her back and chest remained vigilant, even if they were ornamental. She never closed all of them. She cared for [Brahmiel (Brahm)] with a stern voice and a firm hand through darkness.

Was a lover to [Shivyana].

Left on a [Tuna] to [☁️ Fomrh] seeking better things for herself. Bitter at [Guarmiel the Lamb]'s departure and angry at [Shivyana] (and possibly Brahm).
