# 🚪 pestles

{🌐 The Pantry,🔴 inner ring}

Magical two-way gateways between [🌐 The Pantry]'s 9 [🌍 planes]. Each pestle leads from [The Mortar] to one of the planes, and each is different. They are highly regulated, and each side is guarded and administrated by the plane to which it connects from The Mortar.

Most of the pestles are located in or around [The Fulcrum].
