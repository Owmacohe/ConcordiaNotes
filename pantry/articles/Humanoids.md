# Humanoids

{🧑 races,💀 Reht,Playable races}

Ambitious, violent, emotional, and compassionate, humanoids experience existence fuller in comparison to other [🧑 races]. Varied, but not as much as some such as [Florafolk] or [Celestials]. Humanoids are often industrialists, tinkerers, or builders. While incredibly common and even ubiquitous, one rarely find them in the farther reaches of [⚫ The Sparce].

All humanoids typically live between 80-100 years.

*Players' note: The playable humanoid races in [🌐 The Pantry] are Humans, Dwarves, Halflings, Gnomes, and Goliaths. See [Kromacvin] if you want to play an elf-like character.*
