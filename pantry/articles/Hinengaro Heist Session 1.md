## **Timeline**

### **Awakening on the ship**
- Crew has been travelling on a retrofitted [Horseshoe] class starship
- It's taken them a few days to travel from [🐐 Aaliat], and now they're getting very close
- Each member slowly wakes up in the following order:
   1. **Emmaryn:** Low humming and whirring noises
   2. **Jebedda:** A small gravity failure warning
   3. **K999:** The whole ship starts to shake and list to the side
   4. **Dino:** Full klaxon and ship descent
- Possibilities for [🪨 Remora] story beats

### **Arrival on the star**
- If they query the helm (it may start up on its own):
   - The gravity of the star is far stronger than they had expected
   - An emergency landing can be attempted, but the ship will need some time to vent and recycle its engines
- They can try and angle the engines so that the ship lands safely *(DC 15-17 to know how to do this)*
- If all else fails, they crash land, rolling 1d4 damage as they impact. If this happens, the ship isn't usable on the return

> The star is a massive disc-shaped object. At its centre, light gathers so bright its almost hard to look at, and pure white energy spews up and down out into the Sparce. As you step out, your feet meet solid ground; a glassy floor made of solid light. Stardust and mist swirl about, slowly solidifying into columns, archways, and ceilings. You're enveloped in a forming environment, not unlike an enormous glowing train station.

### **Getting into the compound**
- A star magic empowered [Construct|Constructs] sits at a large elevated desk in front of an impossibly tall door
   - Genderless
   - Many dangly jewels
   - Light coming from with
   - Six arms, each embedded in a slot on the desk
   - Head follows them wherever they go
- Large banging and shaking can be heard from behind the door
- The Construct tells them that today is not a good day and that The Browbeat is in a fell mood
   - If they question further, they can find out that the [Flowlines|🌌 The Flow] that usually pass through the area have disapated
   - The star is slowly dying
   - She's losing control of the raw gravitational power within her
- They can:
   - Persuade *(DC 16) (DC 9 if they make it known who they're here on behalf of)*
   - Bribe *(DC 18)*
- Intimidation is met with no response
- They can barge in if they first distract the Construct *(DC 16)*

> As you enter, the doors open into another impossibly large chamber. This one however is nearly pitch black. On the far side of the room, the distance of three or four city blocks, the gigantic maw of a furnace sits open, embers smouldering within. Two or three Constructs walk here and there, moving giant tools, scrap metal, and glowing orbs.

> Hunched in front of the forge is The Browbeat. her upper torso protrudes from the ground, legs nowhere to be seen. Pure light forms her body, wrapped and draped like cloth about her. Upon her head rests a a crown with three burning stars set into it. Though her skin glows like the walls of the previous room, her eyes are deep empty black pools.

### **Fighting the star**
- She initially tells them to leave
- If they persist, she engages combat *(Hill Giant pg. 155)*
   - *Greatclub is 1d8 + 5*
   - *Rock is 1d10 + 5, and deals fire damage*
- If they barge in instead of convincing the Construct, she'll throw burning coals from the furnace *(Rock attack)*
- Fight lasts for 3 rounds, after which her rage subsides

### **Getting the key**
- After the fight, she calms down
   - The fight let her regain some limited strength
- She explains that their employer has agreed to divert shipment of raw [🪨 Remora] to her in exchange for the key
- A False Key needs care, but her strength is so erratic, she's afraid of breaking it
- However she doesn't have enough energy to make it alone
   - They can do it themselves, but it will be much more difficult
   - Or they can overload it by forging it physically, but this is much more volatile and less effective
   - If they overload it, she'll lose physical form for the next few decades
- If they do it themselves:
   - She aids them in opening their minds to the Key
   - They find themselves each in one of their memories, and must succeed on a respective saving throw
   - The amount that they succeed/fail by determines effectiveness
- If they brute force it, it's (2 * damage)% effective
   - They each have one turn to hit it with as much damage as they can
   - The star hits it too (with 3d10 + 5 fire damage)
   - 70

### **Escaping**
- While this is happening, [Hinengaro registry|The Hinengaro Registry] warrior monks have landed on the star
   - *Cult Fanatic pg. 345 and 2 Acolytes pg. 342*
- If they did it themselves, the star tells them to hide when they come back. They must sneak past the monks who enter
   - 3 sets of group stealth checks
   - If they're seen, a chase ensues
- If they work together, the star tells them to get out as fast as possible
   - 3 sets of combat-like escaping rounds to get out of the forge room
   - 1/3 chance that they're each struck by falling debris which deal 1d6 damage
   - Once they exit, they're confronted by the monks
   - If they didn't barge in, the Construct helps them by immobilizing the monks
- The Construct informs them to take the monks' ship if they crash landed 

### **Getting on their/a ship**
- If they didn't crash land, they can escape on their ship
- If they did, they can steal the monks' ship

## **NPCs**
- [The Browbeat Crucible]
- Browbeat Crucible doorkeeper
- Browbeat Crucible staff
- [The Hinengaro Registry] mercenaries
