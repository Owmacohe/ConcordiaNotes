17th emperor of the [Dalha Empire], and son of the famed [Wyeku Aum]. Alhammarret's father lead his empire's forces to war against [⏳ Krom] in [~pc1,400|Passage Consideration], which eventually lead to Wyeku's death and the Dalha Empire's loss over control of trade rights in and around [The Mortar].

In the years that followed the empire's loss, Alhammarret's growing fear that his father's legacy would once again be tarnished caught the eye of [Yyenwid Watazhat], who granted him divine provenance and terrible power. Alongside [a few notable others|Devil-Eater], Alhammarret was executed at the end of the [Aetivima Period].
