# Autonomous Pilgrim Droids

{⚫ The Sparce,The 214th Isotoxal Compact,🔧 technology,Hīkoi Period}

A broad term for the many forms of mechanical and digital robotics sent by some on pilgrimages across [🌐 The Pantry] in their stead.

Due to the vast nature of [⚫ The Sparce] between the [🌍 planes], travel can be very difficult for many. To achieve their religious goals nonetheless, services exist for (usually) tiny, ubiquitous, and low-tech droid services are available. These droids can often be seen crowding around underfoot on [💺 passenger] [🚀 starships], equipped with cameras, prayer LCD displays, and a navigation system.

Various pilgrim droid [🏢 companies] exist, offering a range of services from full asynchronous blessing guarantees, live 24/7 travel logs, and return trips. The larger companies are often audited and regulated by [The 214th Isotoxal Compact], as the service is in high demand.

Though almost all are usually insentient, [Constructs] do occasionally take up this role, for a premium price.
