The two were quite used to each others' company, as they spend many evenings together, in contemplation. Among other deeds. They had become acquainted purely on a formal basis, but quickly grew close, which confounded many of their peers (especially [Voquev Gol'iead], who thought themselves to be much closer to the god of The Wind than many others). No matter the muttering and the whispering of the other [Voquev Gods], Zephyriah and Tieraal still took many such marches as they swapped stories and prose.\n\nThis time however, Zephyriah had arrived bearing a proposition which they had been chewing on, both morally and literally. The concept was posed thus:\n\n\"Imagine a sweet smell. Let it waft from you\" said Zephyriah.\n\n\"It is done\", said Tieraal, who chose their words carefully when speaking.\n\n\"What does it remind you of?\" asked Zephyriah.\n\n\"Deep and low shuddering, and a catalyst of new sprouts\" proclaimed Tieraal.\n\n\"Ah yes, I can smell it too. Though it reminds me more of a hitching gust of blown sand.\"\n\n\"Your words are spun well, my kin.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. Though perhaps I am spun from them.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n30 days passed between the gods' last and next footfall, and in this time, Tieraal had formulated a proper response. They asked: \"\"If you are spun from your words, then what I am spun from?\"\" At this particular moment, Zephyriah was in the process of commanding 6,432 air elementals in a great and terrible siege against the fortress walls of [Claster Veyeimall]'s rotting corpse, in which hordes of Demons had begun to take root. It was for this reason that they were only slightly preoccupied, and gave an unthinking answer.\n\n\"You are spun from silence. It is for this reason that we are so well acquainted.\"\n\n\"I am spun from what I choose to be spun from. Silence is just the most comfortable\" said Tieraal, reluctantly.\n\n\"Not for me,\" said Zephyriah. The siege had ended, and they had quieted their kingly aspects.\n\n\"Perhaps you are correct then. I'm fortunate to know one so differently spun.\"\n\n\"As am I.\"\n\nThe two deities continued walking in silence, before parting ways at a 9th-dimensional dive-bar, and never thought of the conversation again. A passing scribe however, had fervently recorded the entire conversation in scripture, and immediately began distributing it en masse. Over the next 40 or so years, this short poem about soul-spinning would form the basis for 6 major world religions, before falling out of popularity and renown.

Their plethora of subraces mirror a range of seven emotions (Love, Joy, Curiosity, Apathy, Jealousy, Fear, Anger).

While popular misconception attributes negativity to the lower castes of Demons, most are incredibly individualistic, and rely only mildly on their emotional designation.

Their skin is extremely sensitive just like their emotions, and as such, they will often receive many small scars across their bodies as they age. These scars will initially heal green, but will shift up to blue, mimicking their species' natural skin tone shift.\n\nDemons possess a strange magic quality which allows them to perceive strong emotions related to their particular subrace in individuals, but only if they have formed a 'pact' with said person. Pacts come in many forms, and are often tailored to the individuals in question. Pacts are not reversible, and can be risky if performed between two Demons. As such, inter-Demon pact-making is generally frowned down upon on Yeima.\n\nIf a Demon makes enough pacts (usually an extremely high number) with a particular being, they begin to lose their sense of self, and even corporeal form.

Know that this was not the way I wanted to meet. But I'm so glad you were able to make it. You probably have many questions.\n\nI'm not sure if you were aware, but you were dead. Quite handily so. No trace, as far as we could tell. Pretty much vaporized... Probably best to just say it: [Re-materialization|Flow Re-materialization] is a finnicky science. We brought you back from nothing.

They're not so friendly off world, and they definitely don't want us shipping aid to mining colonies.\n\nI know this is probably all a lot to handle right now, but, I have one more matter. I'd love to help get you on your way, back to picking up your lives, but I'm stretched thin as it is. I'm willing to offer you all a ship, but it comes with a job. An official one. It's not combat, I wouldn't put you to that. we have a small fleet of information gathering, purely non-political. You'd be in our employ, but free to choose which tasks you take.\n\n### **They head off in the direction of their first mission**\n\n- Mission: Bring critical supplies to a nearby outpost that they recently lost contact with. They were going to check it out themselves, but had been ambushed\n- Given a crew: Engineers to fill out the ranks.

In time, you all settle into your various nooks and crannies, and get ready for your first voyage aboard The Crystal Ship. (Anything they want to do before leaving). When the time comes, the support structs and scaffolding holding the ship in place are removed, the Orca's bay doors are opened, and your ship slowly begins to lift. It edges out of the doors, and hangs for a moment freely suspended in [The Sparce], before slowly picking up speed. You glide out and away from the main ship arcing around to head a course. With your reforged hearts, a destination charted, and minds on the future, you head out into the unknown.\n\n---\n\n## **NPCs**\n\n- [Commonwealth|The Sparcian Commonwealth] soldiers\n - Captain [Bran Hegan]\n - [Ver]\n - [Dure]\n - Kolb, Anger Demon (Scout, p. 347)\n- Ship doctors\n - Kaed, Halfling (Acolyte, p. 342)\n - Talira, Kromacvin (Commoner, p. 345)\n- Ship engineer\n - LIV, Construct (Guard, p. 347)\n- New crew\n - [Twis]\n - [Reffiq]\n\n---\n\n## **Nearby happenings**\n- A firefight happening between a [Barracuda] Conclave ship and a modified [Cuttlefish] Commonwealth ship\n - Cuttlefish is losing\n - Gets swept away into [The Flow]\n- 3 [Fear Demon|Demons] lab interns are hiding, huddled inside a storage closet\n - Cling to whoever saves them\n- 5-6 communications and logistics officers have found a cache of guns and are fighting back\n - They lose a couple before being aided by soldiers\n- Warehouse workers are pushing large covered barrels of [Remora] down the hallway\n - They mumble incantations and warding spells as they pass","Tags":["Crystal Ship Sessions","The Orkha","private"],"TaggedBy":[]},{"Title":"Episode 2: Forces At Play","Body":"## **Session notes**\n- [Brahmiel (Brahm)]\n - Made ship persona ([Shivyana])\n - Bought spices & get contact info\n - Payed for ship blessing\n - Sanity effect\n- [Mule]\n - Made ship persona (Nid)\n - Bought rabbits (ate one, gave one to [Sulwyn])\n- [Penellaphe (Pen) Astaseul]\n - Evaded the [Regiment 7] ship\n - Talked to [The Remora Guild]\n - Talked to [Sulwyn]\n - Cleaned the ship\n- All\n - [Reffiq] made ship persona ([Bran Hegan])\n - Found who was following them\n - Got lost in the hallways\n - Fought the mummies and won\n - Got the 3 artifacts\n - Spoke to [Cardamom] about the mummies\n\n---\n\n## **Session goals**\n- Kick off the first of a series of episodes\n- Run ship combat\n- Introduce moral ambiguity about [The Sparcian Commonwealth]\n- Introduce more examples of life in [The Sparce]\n- Further the relationship between [Reffiq], [Twis], and [the party|Crystal Ship PCs]\n\n---\n\n## **Timeline/scenes**\n\n### **Exposition / early downtime / contact with [Ver]**\n- Important ship information\n - Safe contains 200 [chits] at the moment\n - Current job pays 75 CHT\n - For practicality's sake, [Twis] and [Reffiq] will stay on the ship during most jobs\n- 2 crates loaded on to the ship before departure ('VOID IF TAMPERED' seal)\n - 4 flat and wide packages in each\n  - Medical supplies\n  - Non-perishable food\n  - [Remora] rations\n - Weapons carefully inserted inside packages\n  - Long sabres in tent poles\n  - Knives in first aid kits\n  - Guns taped around with rice\n- After waking the next morning, they have most of the day to themselves (arrival estimate of ~4pm)\n- Time to settle into rooms / common area\n - How would they decorate?\n - Do [Brahmiel (Brahm)] and [Mule] want to make ship personas?\n- Raw [Remora] starts to crust up on the outside of the ship\n - Takes the vague form of backstory references and/or reflects whatever mood each member is in\n - [Shivyana], curled and shaking for [Brahmiel (Brahm)]\n - Heads of [Penellaphe (Pen) Astaseul]'s fathers pressed together\n - *Hive for [Mule]?*\n- In time, [Ver] contacts them with a mission briefing and info about future jobs\n - Job description: Deliver the crates to the main port of [The Soetanto Trading Outpost], to [Cardamom]\n - They're free to explore the trading market, and gather what goods they need to make the ship more at home\n - The central temple is especially recommended\n - She's installed a map functionality on the ship\n  - **Show map** \n - The group is near the outer planar rim, closest to [Reht]\n\n### **Followed by / combat with a [Regiment 7] ship**\n- [Helm|ship helms] informs them of the approaching ship\n - Had noticed it out at about 50 fathoms, but it has now reached 10 fathoms\n - Will now be here in about 15 minutes\n- If group waits, it will attack\n- If they run, it will give chase, but peel away after they get within 25 fathoms of [The Soetanto Trading Outpost]\n- [Barracuda]\n - 200 HP\n - 18 AC\n - 14 PP\n - 37 fph\n- Light crew of 5\n - **Stat block below**\n - One gets sucked out into [The Sparce] as soon their ship is boarded (Human)\n - One is hiding (Halfling)\n - The other 2 + guard beast stand and fight (Construct and Human)\n  - Beast joins the fight once one hits half health\n- DC 12 Investigation to find Jaleah\n- DC 16 Arcane or INT check to find memo (bypassed with Jaleah)\n- Garbled [Regiment 7] attack plan memo:\n\n> 6 CTL through Zopil.\n> 2 SRD from Mort. docks\n> 3-4 BRCD in construction through Seot. ports\n\n> \"\"Follow the lanes.

The operation itself is built into and around a large temple, itself situated large and sprawling on an asteroid (~1/10th the size of The Moon). As you get closer, small patches of encampments and minor towns can be seen along its surface, the largest of which is your destination. [The Crystal Ship] enters the atmosphere, and you make your way toward the town's large landing pad, which is in fact located in a wide courtyard at the centre of a temple. A massive array of communications spires, atmosphere producers, and metallic holy symbols are clustered in makeshift towers all over the temple's roof. The temple itself is made of pale grey and while stone, and is extremely simple in design (though quite spread out).\n\n- Arrival at loading bay\n - Fully-packed landing strip\n - Mostly [freight] and [harvest] vessels\n - A few other, smaller ports cluster around the main terminal, where they land\n- Conversation with [Cardamom]\n - Introduces herself\n - Inquires about how small the shipment is, but thanks them nonetheless, saying that these outposts need to be held strong under [The Sparcian Commonwealth]\n - Provides info about the trade outpost\n  - Age of the temple (since before the oputpost)\n  - Strategic location (connected to all major routes and [Flow|The Flow] lines in [Soetanto] and [Bhava] provinces)\n  - The temple provides universal [chit|chits] compensation for all local residents, and acts as storage and distribution for the province's [Commonwealth|The Sparcian Commonwealth] branch\n  - Notes that they are welcome to explore the surrounding market while the goods are being processed.\n - Offers ship services\n  - Magical blessing (5 CHT): Advantage on next navigation check through difficult space\n  - Tune ups (10 CHT): Full repair of starship\n- Checking goods\n - If obviously tampered:\n  - [Cardamom] speaks with the party\n  - She chastises them a bit, noting the importance of trust among servants of the cause\n  - She lets them off the hook, but mentions that she'll let [Bran Hegan] know, and that the price will be reduced by 1/3\n - If not tampered:\n  - She thanks them for their service\n  - Pays them in full\n - If secretly tampered (DC 17 to notice):\n  - She makes no mention of the tampering\n  - Secretly contacts [Bran Hegan]\n- Sends a spy to tail the party while they're off the temple grounds\n\n> You exit the landing pad ear in the direction that [Cardamom] directs you. Passing through a short stone hallway, you come out on the exterior of the temple. Immediately you are struck with the business of the market. The landing pad was busy, but here, shops, caravans, and pedestrians clog the narrow streets and alleyways.\n\n> The market extends out in all directions; a criss-crossing maze of covered streets. Beams of light stream down through holes in the tarps and thin fabric that hang over the jumble of bodies. You see mostly Humanoids, being so close to [Reht], but as [The Soetanto Trading Outpost] is such a hub, there are folks from all around here, and goods from far and wide.\n\n- DC 16 Perception to notice the spy\n - Karlel, [Celestial|Celestials], he/him\n - Cloudy eyes, rings around his head, 4 legs (back are bovine)\n - First asks if they have any alms to give\n - Opens up to further questioning\n - Refuses to stop following them, but not hostile\n- Spices and cooking supplies\n - The Soup Haul\n  - Run by Beans, the Bear [Zoofolk] (he/him)\n  - Specializes in custom soups, but also sells specialty ingredients\n  - 5 CHT for soup, 1-2 CHT for each satchet of ingredients\n - Elrin the Human's spice menagery (she/her)\n  - Subscription-based spice newsletter / delivery system\n  - 7 CHT per month\n- Religious artefacts and curios\n - Lost And Scrounge\n  - Run by Ierol, the Fear [Demon|Demons] (they/them)\n  - Collection of useless artefacts gathered when all the stalls are packed up (p. 134 DMG) (5-20 CHT)\n  - A few specialty items (p. 144 DMG) (20-25 CHT)\n- Electrical doodads\n - Ship part claw machine (next to [The Remora Guild] conversion stand) (5 CHT to play)\n  - Dashboard bobbles (10-15)\n  - Engine grease (16-17)\n  - Deployable disco ball (18-19)\n  - Anti-theft droid (20)\n- [The Remora Guild] trading/conversion stand\n - Sacha the [Kromacvin] (she/her)\n - Arhum the [Human|Humanoids] (he/him)\n - 10 CHT for 1g Remora\n - 1g Remora for 7 CHT\n - 5 CHT *or* 0.5g Remora for 1 lb food supplies\n - 10 CHT *or* 1g Remora for 1 lb medical supplies\n- [Remora] bar\n - Solmon, the [Dwarf|Humanoids]\n - BYOR or 5 CHT for thumbnail-sized crystal\n - Lounges available, with floor seating and low-stakes games\n- Individuals\n - [Sabbatical] wanderer [Sulwyn]\n - [The Planar Convoke] healers\n  - Group of Rodent [Zoofolk] doctors\n  - Various specializations (surgeon, kinesiologist, dentist, therapist, etc.)\n  - Took a lot of work top get their visas through to visit the outpost\n  - Most on the outpost are grateful for their presence however\n - [Primordial|Primordials] silent standoff\n  - 2 Earth [Primordials] on one side of the market\n  - 3 Fire [Primordials] at the other\n  - Staring match, but kept civil for now\n  - Will only spark up if chaos is breaks out\n  - 2 Fires killed immediately, other encircled by the Earths\n  - Eventually broken up by [Commonwealth|The Sparcian Commonwealth] soldiers from the temple\n\n### **Ancient [Claster Eprehtt] temple/ruins**\n- After some time, the party returns to the landing pad or is found by an assistant\n - The assistant leads them towards the records room, when they suddenly become separated\n\n> You all turn a corner, and suddenly, the assistant is gone.

Immediately, you turn into a vast cavernous space. A couple stories tall, this seems to be an internal atrium of sorts. Very few beams of light spill in from the spotlight above, illuminating tiles on the stone floor.\n\n> At the centre of the room sits an enormous stone statue of a hunched figure. Nearly as tall as a double decker bus, the stone carving is cloaked, its face hidden from view, legs crossed, and palms resting folded. At the feet of the statue sits a large stone box of sorts, which seems to be built into the ground. All around the base of the figure and the box are carved small intricate runes in tight concentric patterns.\n\n- Rune translations (Higher Speech aka Deep Speech)\n> \"\"And Eprehtt said unto the beings of flesh: Ye Shalt Tumble From The Vantage Of Life, And Be Embraced By Death! And the flesh mourned their passing with reverence and solemnity. The Exhalted Claster found such ceremony to be amusing, and thus a new school of mortality was formed.\"\"\n\n> As your gazes rest at the statue's feet, a shocking scene jumps out. Three figures sit in its shadow; a [Human|Humanoids], a [Celestial|Celestials] (rotted smooth face, hole in chest), and a [Cayman Zoofolk|Zoofolk]. They are withered, heavily bandaged, and beautifully adorned with dusty necklaces and headdresses. They all sit facing the statue, with heads bowed.\n\n- Touching one of the mummies or opening the box triggers the fight\n- Mildly useless magic items in the box\n - Monocle of thick quartz to see 'hotspots' of death\n - 1d4 use, limited potency, life-giving wand (thin, petrified wood)\n - Arm band that stops signs of life from appearing to others (breathing, pulse, twitching, etc.) (delicate earthy colour-stained fabric) (i.e. reveals Somber [aspects])\n- Fight begins\n - **Show map**\n - **Stat blocks:** Mummy (p. 228)\n  - Half health (36), split between all 3 (12 each)\n  - Half damage (1d6 + 3 bludgeoning and 1d4 necrotic)\n - Moths flit from corpse to corpse and animate them\n  - Striking an un-animated mummy brings it to life\n - Ending a turn on any of the patches of light teleports the creature (monster or player) to another patch\n - Cool, fresh air immediately begins to flow in after it the mummy is defeated\n\n^images/maps/soetanto_temple_hidden.png^\n\n### **Back to the ship**\n- Any other needs\n - Market activities\n - Condition of the vessel\n- Meeting with [Cardamom] again\n - She greets them\n - Surprised to hear of the fight, and sends off clerics to sanctify the area immedicately\n - Provides them with healing, if needed\n - Will identify the items if presented with them\n - Lets them know that their ship has been stocked with standard food and water rations\n- [Twis/Reffiq downtimes]\n - Painting parts of the engine and common room\n - Arguing here and there in between about proper use of painting equipment\n- Job board has lit up for the next jobs\n\n### **Next jobs**\n\n> We've heard tell of a few [Commonwealth|The Sparcian Commonwealth] ships disappearing off the coast of [Krom].

Apparently there's a been a gold rush of rare plant materials coming out of the rocks, or so we're told.

General ship audio chatter and distant station pings recede away, and your communications instruments grow silent. Up ahead, for those that can see it, the star looms every larger. By most standards, it's actually quite small, only about the size of an average planet, but its brilliant pale blue light still shines piercingly.\n\n> After 10, 20, 30 minutes of approach, a small ping appears on the radar. Growing ever closer, it appears in fact to be a strange cluster of ship signals. So close they must be sitting right on top of each other. The cluster appears to be bound within the star's orbit, listing slowly far out in a lazy arc. It's now that a second ping sounds. The helm pipes up:\n\n- Helm's description\n - Swordfish class\n - Headed right for us\n - It's sending pings out towards us, attempting to analyse us\n  - Strange pings, in some sort of repeating pattern\n   - -. / . / - / -.- / - / -..-\n   - *(201519)*\n - I can try and analyse it back, but it might need some time (will take 1 minute)\n - Can you keep it distracted?\n- Combat begins\n - [Swordfish] class\n  - Speed: 50 fph or 300 ft/round\n  - 250 HP\n  - 18 AC\n  - 14 PP\n - If they lose, they get absorbed\n\n> A final blast rocks the ship. The lights flicker, sputter, then go out, before being replace by the amber glow of the backup lighting. The helm goes silent; the ship is dead in the water, stalled from the barrage. The gravity magic has apparently been disabled too, and you all begin to float in place. You can all hear the rumble of the Swordfish ship's engines as it passes overhead, its weapons now suddenly silent. Your ship lurches, and you can hear the grinding of metal. Pen, you suddenly see something wriggling into view on either side of your head around the helm. At the same time, down in the combat terminal, Mule you see small glowing ethereal tendrils begin to creep out from behind the keyboards that surround you. *Same for wherever Brahm and Beets are.*\n\n> The tendrils begin to unfurl faster now, reaching out for you through the air. Suddenly, they seem to leap, curling around and attaching themselves to the backs of your heads.\n\n- DC 16 CON save (group check)\n\n> The feeling is immediate. A great wash of exhaustion comes over you, and you vision blurs. In the back of your mind, the sound of static grows and grows. So loud it gets that it eclipses all thought. You fall unconscious, floating aimlessly in zero gravity.\n\n- Highest CON save failure gets to see the ship being towed towards the cluster (if all fail)\n - Successful checks are unaffected\n- If they win, they can explore the ships\n - [The Compiler], [The Assembler], and [The Linker] are all safe in the defence ship\n\n### **Exploring other ships**\n\n> Peering out of the windshield, you can new get a better look at the strange cluster of ships before you. It's a dense tangle of starships of all kinds, from combat to passenger, all floating haphazardly together. They're connected by wires, cables, and anchors, as well as the eerie pale blue arcane tendrils. You see ships from the Commonwealth and Convoke alike, and many more who's insignias and colours you don't even recognize. As you float closer and the ships twirl in the void, the centre of this cluster is revealed. A large, interlocking metal knot sits nestled in the middle of it all. The object appears to be constantly shifting, its gears and geometric sides rotating and grinding against each other. From it extend all the glowing tendrils which connect to the ships.\n\n- If they won, they can visit any number of the ships\n- If not, the defence ship has connected them up to the cluster\n - Roll 1d6, 1d4, 1d2, etc. to determine which ship comes connected next\n - Every 1-2 ships, there's other options to explore\n- Defence ship\n - [Swordfish]\n - [The Compiler], [The Assembler], and [The Linker] are together inside, in a sealed chamber\n - Used to be mercenaries\n - Old model, from ~20 years ago\n- [The Planar Convoke] ship\n - [Lamprey]\n - Embedded in a Commonwealth ship\n  - [Angler]\n  - All crew is dead\n - One person in the cockpit\n - From ~5 years ago\n- [The Sparcian Commonwealth] fleet\n - [Cuttlefish] and a few [Mantis]\n - All gathered together\n - From ~6 months ago\n- [Regiment 7] ship\n - [Squid]\n - Shining plates cover it\n - Crew of 5\n - From ~ 5 years ago\n- Giant cruiseliner\n - [Angelfish]\n - 40-50 passengers\n - Travelling from [Reht] to [Fomrh] on a religious excursion\n - From ~10 years ago\n- The occasional [harvest] or [freight] ship\n- The kernel\n - Large bulb-shaped device\n - Humming with some sort of machinery\n - Metal tubes and arms wrap around it, constantly twisting\n - Docking port of the front\n - [Aspect of Om'nd] physical form resides inside\n - Very old and cryptic machinery, age > 200 years\n - Raises and lowers gravity periodically more and more as they get closer to it through the ships\n\n### **Entering the Kernel**\n\n- Inaccessible from connected ships\n - Only entrance is from outside\n- Docking port for ships, but also manually accessible\n- Thumping comes from within, if unable to calm the Aspect after the internal battle\n- Requires access code\n - *(201519)*\n - Can be accessed by brute force\n - DC 18 INT check to correlate all instances of code to this lock\n\n> **If opening:** You hear a loud thunk noise, then a hydraulic hissing noise as the door unhinges. It's incredibly thick, and requires effort to pull open.\n\n> **If destroying:** Your blast compacts the door, tearing the machinery all around it. In the weightless environment, it floats back towards you off of its hinges. It appears to have been quite thick.\n\n- If opening the kernel, and not having been absorbed yet, light spills out and tendril unfold lazily\n - Strong and immediate absorption\n - No clear visuals inside, save for the memory of a turning hooded face\n- Otherwise, it seems to be sleeping\n\n> The inside of the machine is incredibly small. Almost half the diameter of the external spherical shell, and the interior is lined with wires and lights. Floating, quietly and serenely among the electrical equipment is a small creature. No larger than a cat, it hangs suspended, its limbs curled in on itself. *See [Aspect of Om'nd] description, but smaller, almost juvenile.*\n\n- If taken out, the simulation flickers, and begins operating at a low capacity\n - Will completely dissolve after 1-2 hours, and the inhabitants will awaken\n\n### **The Waiting Room (skippable if needed, save for visions)**\n\n- Lowest previous CON save wakes up first\n - Others are seated in chairs beside\n\n> You open your eyes to bright light. You can hear the faint tinkling of chimes, as if blowing in the wind. You're sitting in small room with adobe pastel walls and a door on each side. In the room are a various assortment of chairs and potted plants which sit on the floor. At one end of the room is a large reception desk. Behind it sits a figure, not unlike the form in which the helm first presented itself to you. Two more figures sit in chairs across from you. Up on the side of the wall ahead of you is a mechanical device showing a row of numbers (201516).\n\n- Doors are shut and inoperable\n- Receptionist\n - Seems to be writing something behind the desk, but upon observation, there is no paper or pen\n - Stops writing when they stop talking\n - \"\"Welcome to the waiting room, please have a seat. You will be with us shortly.\"\"\n - Gestures towards the mechanical device\n- Waiting 1\n - Appears to be reading a book, but holds nothing in their hands\n - \"\"Ah, you must be the new arrivals. We'll be there soon!\"\"\n- Waiting 2\n - Tapping their foot and twiddling their thumbs\n - \"\"Have you been waiting long? They'll call you in time.\"\"\n- DC 14 Perception check to tell that the environment is cracking\n- After some time, it becomes much more apparent\n - Glowing fractures crackle along the walls\n - Bits of the ceiling begin to crumble and fall\n - After some time, the floor falls out\n\n> The mechanical device above whirrs to life, and the rightmost number turns with a clicking sound from 6 to 9. *(201519)* Suddenly, the floor shifts, crunches, and splits open below you. You begin to fall. *Opportunity for player action.* You tumble, spiralling into the bright void. Below you, a hole is growing larger, like a great maw ripping in space. Your fall slows, jerkingly, until you're flowing downwards as if almost in a stream or current. At last, you merely glide through the hole, passing from the white void to a vast landscape of grass and rolling hills. Your feet gently touch the ground, and the hole above you snaps shut with a vacuum sound, and you are left alone to the sound of swishing grass. Above you, moody clouds wander along the sky for as far as can be seen. Behind you lies a calm but brooding sea, lined by a thin strip of ever-stretching beach.\n\n- If they break out early:\n - Small flits of light can be seen spiralling around them as they fall\n - Some get quite close, flying through legs and around heads\n - If grabbed, the character receives a random vision of the memory of The [Aspect of Om'nd] (DC 8 Acrobatics check)\n - Also, temporary 2 hour +2 boost to WIS and CHA\n- If they fall through after waiting:\n - Same thing as above, but the lights are harder to catch (DC 16 Acrobatics check)\n - Lights are further away, moving much faster\n - Scatter when the floor breaks away\n\n- Visions:\n 1. A council of entities, all sitting comfortably on pillows made of galaxy clusters. They are slit down the middle, half of which are screaming and cursing the other half.\n 2. Two hands wrapped around a still and sullen face. The eyes blink. Warmth flows from the hands, into the face, and it gasps, sentience filling its eyes.\n 3. The player character sees themself, standing alone in a void. The view approaches, morphing itself and its sentiments. Thousands of calculations flit through its mind, and hidden arcane tendrils latch viciously into the character.\n\n### **Big reveal / false denouement**\n\n- If they get out early:\n - They appear a few metres behind [The Compiler], [The Assembler], and [The Linker]\n - All 3 have their backs turned, and they're muttering amongst themselves\n - They are trying to find out where they went, and are manipulating the interspace\n- If they wait it out:\n - They appear in an empty field\n - [The Compiler], [The Assembler], and [The Linker] approach them (lustrous descriptions first)\n\n> **Brahm:** Glowing sigils and runes float aimlessly about your head, twisting and reforming. Behind you radiate faint translucent arms that trail after your 4 arms as they move. Your robes seem to blow in a magical breeze that affects only you, and golden horned pauldrons sit upon your shoulders.\n\n> **Mule:** Your chitinous hide, once green and dull, is now coated in a golden sheen, and gleams in the light. A thin pointed crown floats above your head between your antenna. Your speedo is now accompanied by matching red bell bottoms and drooping sleeves. You leave golden footprints behind you, which fade quickly.\n\n> **Pen:** Mimicking your golden jewellery, many chains, hoops, and dangly earrings now adorn your horns, head, and fingers. Two thin, slowly-spinning discs encircle your horns, and similar discs sit around your wrists and ankles. Your uniform glimmers with countless sigils, now seemingly embroidered into the fabric.\n\n> **Beets:** Faint golden outlines of your head float on either side of your face, faint enough to be unnoticed. In patches along your fur, the ends of the hairs are faintly tipped in gold, giving a fawn-like dappling pattern here and there. Glowing pollen seems to radiate up and out of your body when you sit still.\n\n- **[Reffiq]:** Large ethereal gowns flow from him, almost weightless in the air. Large decorative spikes pierce his skin, in his ears, arms, face, and chest.\n- **[Twis]:** Decorative clouds shift and rumble around their head and shoulders. Their elbows and knees sport decorative cuffs, and small golden mouth tattoos appear all over their body.\n\n- They seem familiar and comfortable to them, but do take some time to get used to\n- The trio greets them, with [The Compiler] at the head\n - She welcomes them, acknowledging their confusion\n - She's happy to have them here, but apologies for the mode of arrival\n- All 3 introduce themselves\n - [The Assembler] hopes that they like their lustrous [aspects]\n - [The Linker] mentions that it took a lot of effort to connect their strange ship up\n- Compiler leads them towards [The Helm Interspace]\n - It materializes before their eyes, similar to how helms do\n - Entities begin to walk around them\n - The buzz of connection flows through the air, like small burst of lightning, flashing, and reforming\n\n> What now stands before you is a finely crafted arrangement of halls, towers, stacked buildings, and pointy spires. Resembling a large open square, this campus-sized area is dotted with towers, and individuals rove all over. Though the large courtyard in which you stand is the centre of the space, one large round tower in particular stands above all else. Lighthouse-shaped in design, it emits a thin blue beam, which passes slowly over the surrounding grass fields.\n\n- [The Compiler] explains that they are in [The Helm Interspace]\n - A digital-arcane space akin to a helm cockpit\n - They were able to connect up multiple helm spaces and support multi-entity instantiation\n - The three of them care for the visuals, entities, and connection of the helms\n- She explains that the interspace exists with thanks to their lord, and his great vision\n - All power flows from him\n - All is made better in his domain\n- Though they work hard for the good of the community, none were born here\n - All were brought here by the roving ship outside\n - It is corrupt entity, a defence protocol of the lord's, gone erratic\n- The ship outside, and internal 'fractures' have been getting worse as the cluster slowly drifts into the star's inner orbit\n - They fear that they may be irreversibly close in another half year or so\n\n> It should be noted that all here are free to leave, though most find this place to be welcoming, homely, and frankly, better than life through the void. Here, we see factions cohabitate in harmony, when once they would war. Here, we see the end of disease, the end of politics, the end of pain.\n\n- [The Assembler] pipes up: on that note, our lord would like to speak with you\n - Afterwords, we would be happy to see you to the exit\n- Various people greet them along the way\n - They can be seen reading, talking, running, etc.\n- As they approach the tower, the light from the top which shines down, passes over them, and they feel its static for a moment\n\n### **Meeting with The [Aspect of Om'nd]**\n\n- The 3 lead the party up the tower\n - Circular staircase\n - Static gets slightly louder as they approach\n - Where before, the walls and atmosphere had this intangible artificial quality to it, everything seems to much clearer now\n- [The Compiler] explains that the 3 found themselves stranded in this world, many years ago, their bodies washing up upon its shores\n - There to greet them was their lord\n - He showed them the future that they could grasp, and shape to their wills\n - He gave them purpose in a fractured world\n- She cautions them to address him as \"\"my lord\"\", and warns that they may feel some discomfort at first\n- They reach the top, coming up into a small room\n\n> In the middle of the room, seated upon blankets and fine rugs, is a large beast. Its body, lion-like in physique, has six legs (the front pair of which are human arms and hands), and blue/green fur. Furled neatly on its sides are two massive fleshy wings, devoid entirely of feathers. Its head, wreathed in a large unkept mane, rises up a little higher than it probably should on its neck, in an almost humanoid way. Where its face should be, there is nothing. A gaping black hole like a mask stares out towards you, turning to face you as you ascend the final steps. No smell comes from this creature, but a slight static sound fills the air, growing in volume when its \"\"gaze\"\" passes over each of you in turn. Seated on either side of the lord are two entities, similar to those featureless ones you met in the waiting room.\n\n- The three guides step forward, and face you, and speak one at a time:\n\n> **The Compiler:** You stand now in the presence of the Lord of Fabrication. Progenitor of our shared interspace, and author of our true peace.\n\n> **The Assembler:** Known by many names: That Which Bends; Odenmos, Reality Consumer; Following Child of Voquev Vivanyr; Aspect of Simulacra.\n\n> **The Linker:** Yyenwid Om'nd, God of the Helm.\n\n- Through the haze of their words, each hear a singular, piercing voice ring out in their minds\n\n> **Brahm:** What warmth do you seek, spiralling through the cosmos? I can give you sanctuary again, here with the masses.\n\n> **Mule:** What unity do you seek, scurrying through the dust? I can give you true purpose here, drone among many.\n\n> **Pen:** What salvation do you seek, toiling in obscurity? I can give you redemption, here in the eyes of all.\n\n> **Beets:** What penance do you seek, trodding empty roads? I can give you one worthy of worship, here at pilgrims' end.\n\n- [Aspect of Om'nd] speaks through the mouths of his attendants\n - He welcomes them to his helm interspace\n - He hopes that they are pleased by his artificial splendor\n- Explains most of the history of [The Helm Interspace] if asked\n - The Kernel\n - The first inhabitants\n - His goals\n - The looming star\n - He has been iterating on his interspace with a total of 201 inhabitants, in different versions for 519 years\n - *(201519)*\n- He knows that they have duties which pull them elsewhere\n - But offers that they stay for a few days\n - Time passes much faster in here, and not but an hour will have passed... out there\n\n### **If they decide to leave the [helm|ship helms] interspace**\n\n- The [Aspect of Om'nd] ushers them forward\n - He asks them to relax, wrapping his front arms around them\n - If they relax and peer into the void of his face, they find themselves tumbling into darkness\n- The others see the one departing filter away like falling sand, similar to what happens when someone exits a helm simulation\n\n> Once again, you find yourselves tumbling, this time through darkness instead of light. Below you, you can feel your body. You senses slowly return to you, and you can feel your physical form floating weightless in zero-gravity.\n\n> The closer you get however, the more the environment shudders around you. Shockwaves of air pass you by as you fall, and cracks form around you in the darkness. You can still feel your forms below you, stirring to consciousness, but you can also see through the cracks now, out towards the campus you just left.\n\n- They hear shouts\n - The campus appears to be \"\"on fire\"\"\n - Ripples in the reality flare up like flame\n- People can be seen fleeing\n- The lighthouse has gone out\n\n> **If they stay:** The void shatters around you into a tiny fragments of dark glass. You land, hard this time, on sand. Once again, you find yourselves on the shores of [The Helm Interspace], facing off towards the endless water.\n\n> **If they leave:** You concentrate on what is real, and your body returns to you. Your fingers twitch as your mind tumbles through the darkness. Suddenly, the two slam together and you jolt awake.\n\n- **If entering from the kernel:** Wake up cradling the [Aspect of Om'nd]'s form\n\n- She ship is still stalled\n- Tethered to the other ships by cabling\n- Out the window, the kernel can be seen sparking\n - The entire cluster is drifting faster towards the star\n - Tendrils lash out wildly\n\n### **If they stay in the [helm|ship helms] interspace (skippable if needed)**\n\n- [The Compiler], [The Assembler], and [The Linker] lead them back down the steps, to rooms where they can stay\n - Curiously evocative of their rooms on the ship\n\n> From there, time seems to pass in a haze. The constructed environment is warm, comfortable, adaptable. It draws you in, not maliciously, but benevolently. Time indeed does pass quickly. Every three hours here brings a new sunset and sunrise, and the flow of other interspace individuals presses around you. *Opportunity for player action.*\n\n> Over the next few days, you are invited as newcomers to participate in various activities. From lectures given by [The Assembler] on the beach, to finely-crafted artificial meals, to fire-side story sharing, you are enveloped in the group. It's welcoming, but leaves you incomplete.

A momentary pause was had, and panic rose up in his chest for but a moment. He pounded it back down with as much mental force as possible, and slowly crept his other hand towards his side lantern. Withdrawing for a moment, he lit the wick, and low orange brilliance scattered about the cramped cave. Aware of the time limit he had just imposed upon himself, he reached up, back towards the flat surface he had fumbled across. In a half-heave, half-lunge motion, he pulled himself up and over the surface. He quickly righted himself and, crouching now as to not bump his head on the fractal roof of the cave, knelt on the almost shelf-like flat protrusion. He studied it but for a moment, its black and very slightly transparent surface humming with the premonition of its contents. His prize, and a large one at that. Reaching from behind, he produced a long curved instrument. Speaking the arcane words, now familiar to him after months of practice, the arc-beam crackled from end to end of the arched tool. Immediately, he set to work holding the beam down flat against the glass-like surface. The humming from within intensified, almost to a fever pitch, and with his last ounces of stretch applied, the flatness below him crunched and shattered.\r\n\r\nHe now knelt in about 10cm of very cold liquid, almost paste-like in thickness. He wasted no time, reaching into the pool, pushing aside bits of broken shards. His hands grasped object after object. Compasses, half-eaten loaves of bread, small devotional figures, a child's wicker ball, three glass eyes, and many more such trinkets. Each find was quickly stashed in his bag, leaving a thick and dark residue on his hands and pack. All that could be easily scavenged was, and before long, the pool was nearly empty. One final grope around was met with the iron-wrought hilt of some stave or halberd. This was the last item to be wrenched from the muck before he hastily climbed back down, landing amidst the cracked stone and uneven floor. Immediately, he shut off his lantern and, knowing the returning path well, proceeded down the corridors. He had not made it 3 minutes before he heard the crackling behind him. Running faster now, as the sound approached, he could see the cave system collapsing in and out of reality. Making it to the [Pestle|pestles] Door in just enough time, he flung himself across its barrier, and landed soundly on soft-grassed ground. Not 3 seconds later, the Door had shuddered, wracked its form, and crumped up completely.\r\n\r\nDusting himself off, he tied the oblong metal staff to the underside of his pack, and rolled up the Door as if a carpet *(see [Portable pestles])*, and started his trek down the hill towards the village.

Designed to be a fashion assistant of socialites she gained the attention of the fashion god Ye (Idk what his name is, but I’m going with Ye now) as K999 was accompanying one of her clients to a party where Ye was present. Ye was attracted to K999 and saw potential and a way to increase their popularity. \r\n\r\nK99 is short, only 1.57m and has had numerous procedures done to her lips, eyes, brow, jaw, cheek, breasts, abs, and most notably her ass. Where she previously sported a very curvaceous look she has recently slimmed down to slightly more realistic, yet still inhuman proportions.\r\n\r\nK999 and Ye married and the wedding day was an extremely elaborate event. Having made an oath of devotion to Ye she promised to always look good and represent contemporary unaffordable streetwear for people that live in gated communities. Through a surrogate, Ye and K999 have four children North, Saint, Psalm and Pantry. All of them are incredibly ill-behaved and mostly raised by nannies.\r\n\r\nK999 did elevate the work of Ye to world fame, but unfortunately, the couple divorced about two years ago. The lawsuit was a mess as Ye turned out to be a bit bipolar and K999 wanted full custody for the children she did not raise. After a year they eventually settled and shared custody and some resources. \r\n\r\nThe divorce was a big blow for K999 as she is losing relevancy fast. She is desperate to keep her name relevant and her picture taken to hold on to her divine powers. Luckily she still has connections with a lot of high-profile people in entertainment. She is using this network to be spotted at as many events as possible. She is willing to do anything if it would bring her popularity.\r\n\r\nShe met the rest of the party at the tavern where she was promoting weight loss potions for a sponsor deal.","Tags":["Hinengaro Heist PCs","private","The Hinengaro Heist","Constructs"],"TaggedBy":[]},{"Title":"Kechok","Body":"## **Physical description**\r\n- he/him\r\n- 62 years\r\n- [Primordial|Primordials]\r\n- Wide, but average height\r\n- Large hole through his head, with a bell inside\r\n- Eyes and face squished around it\r\n- Tassels growing out of his skin\r\n- Broad, worked, yet soft hands\r\n\r\n## **Voice description**\r\n- Christopher Walken, but gruffer\r\n- Stress certain words\r\n- Speak in small bursts\r\n- Eye squints\r\n\r\n## **Character description**\r\n- Union boss on Iera\n- Alongside his workers, helped to finish construction on [The Central Archive] [~20 years ago|Passage Consideration]\r\n- Tries to keep a strong face while navigating the union between the eyes of the [Format government|Format Iera], and the corporate construction partners","Tags":["private","Primordials","Hinengaro Heist NPCs","Format Iera"],"TaggedBy":[]},{"Title":"Krom","Body":"## **Plane of:** Time\r\n## **Primary lifeforms:** Kromacvin\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe labyrinthine and cathedralic halls of the cities of Krom are vast and majestic.

However, sunlight still clung to the snow in great swaths, and the vantage was far from obscured. For this, Adreat was thankful. For her short life of twelve winters, she’d studied and been raised on these spires, cared for by her grandmother and her father. The Bruevar were a collection of three squat but pointed mountains along the southern bank of the great Braurun mountain range. She had been born here, and voyages down towards the base of the hills were far and few between. Nested quietly about the base of the range were deep quagmires where fell beasts dwelt. Or so she was told. Her father, the Mat-Allister of these Bruevar Mountains, was native to those lands and so often wove tales and spun charms which told of dark lurking eyes between the fading trees. He spent most of his time walking lightly in the deep and silent places of the mountain, and so Adreat was only with her father when he returned from the mountain for supper in the evenings. Her grandmother, or Greemaw, was her one and only guide to the life and temperament of the peaks she inhabited. She was a wise and powerful teacher, for she had been bestowed a birthright of immense physical strength from their ancestors; a gift of forebears. Though Adreat had no such gift, nor the arcanity of a Mat-Allister, she was learning and would assume her Greemaw’s duties in ample time.\r\n\r\nFor the past three and a half weeks, they had been preparing for the oncoming of winter. In some weeks time, winds from great deserts and far flung seas beyond imagination would carry cold and harsh winds to the Dorminndar range, and all would be engulfed in threshing sleet. During the long winters, Adreat and her family would gather their summer and falltime placements and retreat up to the safety of the high grottos and caves. The antler-sheep and sextupedal mountain goats would be released for the year, and food, milk, and other provisions would be stashed. In those dark months, they would be sealed away deep inside the forgotten tombs of their predecessors. Adreat’s father had once told her that their lineage deep down in and around the Bruevar mounts was so ancient that if you followed it back further enough, it would be indistinguishable from the very roots of the mountains.\r\n\r\nFor the past two years, Adreat had accompanied her Greemaw for one of the final tasks before their ascent: the collection of fresh water to be stored for winter. For fear of contamination by the encroaching wastelands that ringed the mountains, only the snow on the high and shining peaks could be stored. However, this year, desperation clung fast to her father and her Greemaw’s faces. The summer had been lackluster and windy, and the usually plentiful antler-sheep herds had been shallow. Because of this, her Greemaw spent more than half of her day hunting other mountain game to be cured, smoked, and stored for the winter. This was how the task fell solely to Adreat. To climb high towards the peaks, and bring down the pure snow that fell there.\r\n\r\nThey had bided their time, and waited for a proper sunny day to send her up. Lo it came, one early morning when a brilliant sun crested the jagged horizon. Adreat set off at once, so that she might get a head start if the weather was to change throughout the day. Though her Greemaw wasn’t joining her, she wouldn’t send her granddaughter up the mounts alone. Adreat was to bring Neraline, their mariarch sextupedal goat, with her to help carry skins of snow back down. Her six hooves, perfectly adapted to the shale and ice of the mountain, would guide the pair along their trek. Leaving the falltime encampment, they wound up the gooseberry bath. Passing these semi-cultivated bushes and tinkling shrines with burning incense, they rose. An hour later and all but a few purposefully cut trail blazes, placed there by Adreat’s great-great-uncle, marked their climb. Soon they reached [Goleade|Voquev Gol'iead], Last Shrine To Open Vantage, and this was their sign to start making their way unguided. By now, they had been scaling the dwindling footholds for three hours, and breathing had become tiresome. Adreat was familiar with this sensation; her father had once told her that the reason that the mountains choke nearer to their summits was because that’s where their memories were. She had not understood her father, but she believed every word he said. Behind them the sky was hazy with fog, and far across the tops of the spires, she could see rain falling. Or was it sleet? She couldn’t tell. Pressing into Neraline’s wool, she guided her faster.\r\n\r\nThey had been passing snow for some time now, but still Adreat was worried that it wouldn’t be pure enough. They would make for the small plateau ahead, rest for a quarter of an hour, then make the final push to the summit. Upon reaching the flat outcropping, there was barely enough room for her and Neraline to rest, but it was enough. Around them was only rock, snow, and sky. The last trace of animal life had disappeared an hour ago, and human long before that. All she could see now was the rolling snow-fog and occasional lower mountain summit. Somewhere deep and quiet, thunder rumbled. Adreat knew that ignoring it would do no good, only preparation and good constitution would help them now. After a small bite, Adreat with some old and tough lamb, and Neraline with old and tough roots, they continued. So close they were now, and the top was in sight. A hundred paces and they would halve the distance. Fifty paces to halve that. Twenty-five to in turn halve that. Now, and only now, were they stopped. They were so high that only the Dormunn Spires to the north and the Sødar Mount to the west could be seen. As only her grandmother, great-great-uncle, and great-great-great-grandfather had done before her, she rung the small golden bell that was fastened to the coronet of the mountain. She heard no sound but knew that an identical bell, placed down within the antechamber of the mountain caves would be ringing at that very moment, signalling her climb’s success to her father and grandmother.\r\n\r\nNow was the time. She hastily began shovelling bright white snow into the sheepskins draped and hung from Neraline’s back. Even packing it as tightly and quickly as she was, it was a slow task. For half an hour now, the far and deep rumbling of a sleet thunder storm had been growing louder and closer. Both climbers were aware of this fact, and were beginning to worry. Neraline’s shuffling hooves belayed her nervousness. The moment that the last skin had been packed tight and secured, Adreat begane hastening them back down. The trip down was by far the most dangerous part of the task. Wet shale, hidden ice, and indistinguishable plant growth were mighty adversaries. While the six feet of the native mountain goat were borne for traversing exactly such a terrain, Adreat’s reinforced leather high-tops here having some difficulties. By now, extremely cold raindrops had started to fall on their backs, and the two had to slow down even more. Suddenly and cacophonously, a great white hot scream of lightning careened into the black stone not metres from their feet, and in less than a second everything changed. Stone, fire, snow, and hair clouded Adreat’s vision while she was flung into the air. Caught on hot winds suctioned up from lower on the mountain, she was spun and almost held momentarily in the gust. Then she was dropped. Hard.\r\n\r\nShe awoke, and all was white brilliance. Climbing up through the snow, the way her grandmother had taught her, she erupted in a dark chaos. It was night now, and the great sweeping arms of a snowy tempest raged about her on the mountaintop. Above and around, they seemed to form great beasts of the mountain, unthinkable in form. Steadying her soul and her mind, she peered through the wailing storm, searching for her hircine companion. Some hundred metres below her, she spied Neraline. She was huddled and small against what could one have been an outcropping of stone, and was now only a charred and jagged edge of rubble. In the midst of her climb down to Neraline, Adreat absentmindedly noted that the rocks where the great bolt of lightning had struck were still warm to the touch.\r\n\r\nThe tempest covered their tracks back up almost immediately after they made them, but their direction was clear. Down. Down to warmth, down to family, down to survival. Progress was unbearably slow, as great swaths of burning hail careened at mach speed into their flesh. It was only after an hour of climbing that Adreat realized she was screaming. She didn’t stop. Amid the dread chorus of flying snow, rolling thunder, and her own hoarse wails, she suddenly recognized the harmony. Great gusts and the very furrowed brow of the mountains were twisting and mingling to the sound of her guttural screams. Adreat could feel as sleet and rock passed above, below, and through her. With no understanding or control of her newfound sense, she plunged headfirst into it, breaking open her mind and her body. Blood flung from between her knuckles and under her eyes, and an avalanche of chanting carried the girl and the goat to the brink of unconsciousness. Flashes of light and slow dotted Adreat’s memory as her body and soul, and that of her sextupedal goat companion, were lost to the mountain’s roar. Passing through stone, sky, and ice, they rocketed down the spire.\r\n\r\nIn the coming months, her Greemaw and her father would tell the story of how Adreat and Neraline had appeared the next early morning unscathed, on the doorstep of the mountain cave system. Adreat herself had no recollection of events that passed after she lost consciousness the second time on the mountain. As for the storm, she was told that a great cloud of fog and snow had formed about the peak not long after the bell had rung, and had all but completely disappeared by the morning light. In the coming days, Neraline rejoined the herd, and stayed with them in the winter months while Adreat and her family were up in the caves. The following year, in late summer, she died peacefully in old age. Many summers and many winters would pass before another would be trained to scale the mountain peak again. For that time, it was Adreat only who undertook the task each year. Though there were storms, they never seemed to trouble her. She knew now the secrets of the mountain, for it had told them to her in that black place during the descent. A gift, different to those given to her now old father and late Greemaw continued to guide her. Occasionally she would delight her own grandchildren by awakening the winds and snow around them during bitter autumn nights. When she died at the old mountain folk age of seventy three, her bones and her light quieted and melded with those of the mountain from which she had come, and she was one again with her ancestors.","Tags":["Yadri","Aetivima Period","myths and stories"],"TaggedBy":[]},{"Title":"Operatus Captival","Body":"An extremely obfuscated and under-documented sect of religious fanatics, devoted to [Yyenwid Alpsid].

Ribley disapeared for a week, and upon return regaled their family about the wonders of such a time. The stories always seem to change slightly, but it is clear that Ribley spent time in the Fey realm ( a week for their family but years for them). Ribley always mentions the circus, a group of Fey's who traveled around to different realms and cities, but no one from Ribley's family ever seems to have heard it. While some call Ribley a silly storyteller, it was undeniable the impact of the circus on their life. Ribley's back had begun to grow different fungi, none that seemed to be harmful, but magical in nature. These mushrooms seemed to give them power, allowing them to read minds, manipulate water into weapons, and even alter luck in their favour. Ribley's community was scared of their newfound power, and after \"the incident\" which led to a few injuries, they were asked to leave. Heading on their way and scared for \"the incident\", Ribley was looking for someone to take her in.

The day was bright, and the cold in the air bit playfully against his skin. He had been walking through the night, though he was not tired. The Winding Road had a way of carrying one along, as if on some unseen current. Beside The Monk walked his spirit. His mental image, alike in both mannerism and in form. The two kept each other company, and often commented on the various things that they saw while walking. It was naught but a few hours after the sun had risen and The Monk was passing down the backside of a rolling mountain that he passed a group of merchants. As they approached, they nodded to The Monk. He in turn reciprocated, as did his spirit, though the merchants could not see it. The merchants stopped to ask The Monk directions, as they had been traveling for some time, and had yet to pass by a town or city in which to sell their goods. The Monk told them that he had passed a small mountain hamlet not two peaks back, and that if they hurried they might make it by nightfall, though one could never be certain when walking on The Winding Road. The merchants thanked The Monk, and gave him bread and oil, as was the custom. The monk nodded to them again, as did his spirit, and he carried onwards. The Monk ate the bread as he walked, and offered the oil to his spirit as a ceremonial gesture. His spirit politely declined. The Monk told his spirit how thankful he was to have been met with such kind folk. His spirit agreed, and mentioned how rare that was these days.\r\n\r\nSometime later, The Winding Road on which The Monk was walking diverged. The Monk stopped at the crossroads, unsure of which path to take. His spirit, contrarian in nature, wanted to take the right path which appeared to lead back up and along the mountain. The Monk however was hesitant. He thought that the left path, which appeared to lead down towards the valley, was the proper one. And so, The Monk and his spirit sat down on two rocks nestled beside the fork in the road, and contemplated. The Monk's spirit reminded him that The Winding Road was fickle, and that the left path that appeared to be proper might in fact lead them completely astray. The Monk agreed that yes, The Winding Road was fickle, however he mentioned that the fickler thing still would be if the proper-looking left road was in fact the proper one. At this, his spirit fell silent, thinking. They both mused for some time, and came to the eventual conclusion that their discussion could very easily become cyclical. They had been sitting, and talking, and grumbling for some time near the fork in the road when suddenly an old Aspen Ghost walked out from the brush. The Aspen Ghost came and sat next to The Monk's spirit, and struck up a conversation with it. The Monk himself could not understand a word of what The Aspen Ghost was saying, but his spirit appeared to be having a good conversation. After some time, The Monk's spirit told him that The Aspen Ghost knew which way to go, but would only tell them if he could be given a proper place to rest. The Monk stood then, nodding to The Aspen Ghost, and walked over to a small forest grove next to the fork in the road. He gently ripped aspen saplings and ferns from the ground, and returned to the fork in the road. He bundled the saplings and ferns together, and wedged the bundle into the top of a pile of stones. He lit the bundle ablaze, and stood back to admire his work. The Aspen Ghost clapped his hands, though of course no sound came out, and beamed at The Monk. The Monk's spirit informed The Monk that The Aspen Ghost was very satisfied with the resting place, and would show them the correct path. The Aspen Ghost sauntered off down the left path, beckoning The Monk and his spirit to follow. The Monk winked to his spirit, and followed down after The Aspen Ghost.\r\n\r\nThat evening, The Monk and his spirit had nearly reached the end of The Winding Road. They could see the glitter of the port town near the curving bay, and were both content. They swapped riddles and marched in time, happy to keep each other company. As the night fell, many of the region's fireflies filed in on either side of The Winding Road, following steadily behind The Monk and his spirit. The Monk greeted each firefly in turn, complimenting them on their fine legs and gossamer wings. The fireflies were grateful, and stuck around to keep the path well lit for The Monk. After all of the formalities had been completed, the tiniest firefly piped up to ask The Monk where he was going. The Monk smiled and told the tiniest firefly that he and his spirit had been traveling for three months along The Winding Road, hoping in time to reach his favourite noodle bar near the coast. The tiniest firefly was puzzled, and asked The Monk why on earth he had been traveling for so long just for a noodle bar. The Monk replied simply that the noodles were very good. The tiniest firefly still didn't understand, but kept silent. Just as The Monk was approaching the gates of the port town, and the fireflies had begun to flit back into the bushes and trees, the fattest firefly asked The Monk what he would do after he got his noodles. The Monk replied simply that he would return home. Then The Monk turned, and walked hand in hand with his spirit through the gate and down into the busy port town street.","Tags":["The Winding Road","Hikoi Period","myths and stories","Yadri"],"TaggedBy":[]},{"Title":"The Mortar","Body":"The central hub for travel, trade, culture, and crime in [The Pantry]. 8 [pestles] lead from it to the other individual [planes].\r\n\r\nA set of shattered worlds and small asteroid belts all densely orbiting a nearly-extinguished dwarf star.

Almost as silent as the waves, a figure passed by. Moving from one deep and far place to another, this shade soundlessly left its footprints in the sands of seconds, minutes, hours, years, and even eons.\r\n\r\nThough swift was its passage, the sand under its path was not left untouched. From the footprints and disturbances of its dragging cloak, the grains of time’s past and future were swirled and excited. Dusk and minuscule particles that clung to the hooded figure from its travels fell from it as it marched, and mingled with the dark sand.\r\n\r\nFrom the instant that they touched the ground, they sprung forth with breath, growth, and blood. Time was given to flesh, and life was born.\r\n\r\nAs flesh found form in this age of awakening, the breath of [The Astral Walker] still passed upon shores of both rising waves and shifting crude sands, and life found purpose in following a path it would forever dream to walk. Life, in its first steps, marched onward towards the remnants of a maker with no name. An era before titles could be graciously given, instead were earned; Time, and a great store of it, would pass before any such gift found a bearer.\r\n\r\nMinutes may have passed, or millennia. As equally great are they in their capability for change. No matter the span, in this beginning, the shambling remnants of a greater shade tread in the only direction of comprehension; Forward. As they walked with each shuttered step, unbeknownst to them, they left a trace of self behind in the frigid and misted lands of darkness they travelled, unaware of their own imitation of the fleeting figure they pursued.\r\n\r\nTheir own breath graced the mounds of what would be the first glades, and became the delicate dews that would feed fields of grass to be; Grown from the follicle of skin. Their footpaths would carve canyons, small and dainty in birth, but in blind repetition of retraced steps becoming monstrously grand. With weak frames and tender bodies, skin cracked as they wandered and the ichor that poured fed life to the oceans they passed. Oceans that claimed this fogged land before any, were devoid of life, and became graced anew. These waters instead imitated the lapping of time, and with newfound vigour, licked at new shores. Where life had walked, the waters filled their path to feed the first streams and rivers, taking claim of the shrouded land past where they had pooled for time eternal.\r\n\r\nLife walked ever onward, until the fateful day where flesh learned of its first flaw and greatest incapability. As they dreamed and yearned to follow in the unfathomable steps of this great cloaked wanderer, found themselves at journeys end, in the footholds of where it had begun. Flesh, unlike the bestower of mystic life, could not pass through the wake of time and fold of space; Held firm to the material remains of passing footprint and fallen debris.\r\n\r\nAnd so Life sank, exhausted into the shallow pools and young glades which it had in turn borne. Unable to move further, but now forever bonded to an ideal of pursuit, they and their kin settled into their creations and dreamed. They dreamed that the newly founded oases and pinpoints of life would grow tenfold, overwhelming and overshadowing the ever-shifting sands of time. And so they did.\r\n\r\nTheir children, and their childrens’ children grew and died in an instant, and creation was flung and strewn arc-like across the blind eternities. Footsteps left either by the passage of some primal walker, or the tread of its original pursuers, provided ample resting places for drifting creation to land. Eventually in isolation, in each place where an ancient footstep had fallen, great worlds arose to make pinpricks of light against the breaking of the shores of time. To the first of the Awakened Gods, these growths seemed to rise and fade in matters of seconds, and minutes. Though perhaps it was far longer, as their descendants, who now inhabited these worlds were unrecognizable to them, and offered sacrifice and worship to their ancient ancestors.\r\n\r\nThrough the instantaneous eons, the far-flung ancestors of those first Claster may have forgotten their histories and the settlements of their foreparents, though they never lost their drive and reckless need to follow some nameless goal. Through time this goal would be given many names; survival, progress, religion, love. But in the hearts and minds of all [Descendant Beings|races], their hunger for such an ungraspable ideal would never be sated.

Arrival on [Yeima]\r\n  - Getting the players familiar with playing\r\n  - Introducing stakes\r\n  - First meeting with [Voquev Vehirit] (being compelled)\r\n  - BIG cliffhanger at the end\r\n2. The [starship|starships] within [Claster Veyeimall]\r\n  - Calmer session focused on discovery\r\n  - Character moments and highlights\r\n  - Second meeting with Voquev Vehirit (she opens up)\r\n  - Big reveal: Claster Veyeimall is being awoken\r\n  - The ship is piloted beyond reality\r\n3. The Fisher King upon [The Beach]\r\n  - Strange realities\r\n    - **Alhammarret**: Back in time, set on the coast of Yeima. All of the other characters are foot soldiers. At some point, The Flow comes through, giving Arthur the choice to retire Alhammarret and bring both Blum and Wyvil back. Vehirit aids with this in some way.\r\n    - **Violet**: The Hag within Violet is about to jump ship. Its magic is trong and primal, and letting it exit would have a high chance of being fatal. Vehirit can draw it out, but it would be easier to make it at home. Re-write the reality of Proto-races to blend them back into modern day.\r\n    - **Caius**: On one of the mid-Yeiman spires. Each character is a high-ranking city official. On the council are two unnamed characters that need to be reformed to be Caius's parents again. Vehirit aids with this, in exchange for the sliver of Yinsenvanyr.\r\n    - **Nohr**: The party is a set of proteins, pollens, or fungus spores, building a chain of disease-resistant, hyper infectious DNA, controllable by Nohr. Vehirit helps with this, but is naturally also immune. Nohr infests Truth in this way.\r\n    - **Enya**: The [214th Isotoxal Comapact] was originally founded on Fomhr. But the reality can be changed with Vehirit's help so that it's re-founded on Yeima, with explicit rules for the worship of Voquev Arwa. What's more, the religion can be baked into the very fabric of The Pantry, bringing new forms of life and magic into reality.\r\n    - Each of these realities grants some combat-relevant ability\r\n  - Decision: free Voquev Vehirit or subdue Claster Veyeimall?\r\n    - This is done first as starship combat, then makes its way into traditional combat\r\n    - The result of which determines whether they fight The Fisher King fused with Vehirit or with Veyeimall\r\n    - The other of which aids them in combat as their 'starship'\r\n  - Tell the story of [Veyeimall In Thought]","Tags":["private","Unspooling Song"],"TaggedBy":["Random Unspooling Events","Unspooling Song: Session 1","Unspooling Song: Session 2","Unspooling Song: Session 3"]},{"Title":"Unspooling Song: Session 1","Body":"## In the darkness of the starship\r\n- Roven / Wyvil\r\n  - A dream about leading an army of soldiers across a glowing [Pestle|pestles]\r\n  - Far ahead, the 'catwalk' ends in darkness and soldier are falling off it in spades\r\n  - Behind, other soldiers are whispering, murmuring, and pointing\r\n- Violet\r\n  - Crumpled up on one side of the bay, strapped to a chair and sandwiched in between crates\r\n  - A small glowing blue flower is slowly but visibly pushing itself up through the back of your hand\r\n- Enya\r\n  - Walking the aisles, checking up and making sure everyone's okay\r\n  - You see people from all over. Mostly tourists, but some researchers, some families, some loners\r\n  - At the back of the starship is a multifaith shrine, including a small statue of Voquev Arwa\r\n  - How does the statue depict the god? Do you make a prayer or an offering?\r\n- Nohr\r\n  - Also dreaming, this time of a field of plants, heavy and drooping with large seed pods\r\n  - In the center sits a thousand-legged entity with flowers for eyes\r\n  - As you approach, it speaks to you, asking for you to help it grow its garden\r\n  - Cutting off your limbs, you impale them into the ground, where they extend, unfurl, and bloom, filling the sky with pollen and humid mist\r\n  - This is a good dream\r\n- Caius\r\n  - Looking out the window\r\n  - Starships passing by (Lapetana Packaged Foods LLC, harvest starships, [Oarfish] luxury liners)\r\n  - Sees one of the harvest ships attempt to get close to the spire as they enter the atmosphere\r\n  - It gets pulled, and you can see it activiting its backup thrusters, just barely making it out of the gravitation pull of something beyond your vision\r\n\r\n> The great spire of Yeima rises high, pulling the rest of the land up with it. Draped over and around it, like the infinite layers of some shimmering onion, or insect wing are the curtains of The Unspooling. Massive jagged crystalline tendrils wrap around the spire, and these long sheets of translucent film cover the landscape, raining down from some source above like an explosion frozen in time, and fluttering in the breeze.\r\n\r\n## Rough landing on [Yeima]\r\n- The starship rattles and shakes\r\n- There's a great wrenching sound somewhere deep in the hold\r\n- As the ship begins to pitch, biomechanical speakers sputter to life, and the pilot can be heard uttering a prayer for a smooth emergency landing. He is not afraid. This is standard procedure when near gravitational anomalies\r\n\r\n> Glied, Furnace-Child, come down through the vents. Come down through the lymph nodes. Come down here, through this Helm. Come down and bewitch upon us an aerial descent of 15.3 degrees clockwise. Come down now, Come down.\r\n\r\n> As these final words are uttered, everything WHUMPHs. Then again. Then a long CRSHHHHHHHHH as the starship comes to rest rather ungracefully a little ways off from the makeshift landing strips set up between various encampments and towns. A few hundred feet away, the perimeter of a large carnival begins, leading all the way up to the base of The Unspooling's curtains.\r\n\r\n- Starship hands usher passengers off as the captain and engineers attempt to jump-start the vehicle using an exterior-Helm technique\r\n- The starship hands ask people to please stay with your cabin groups until you reach the nearby towns on the other sid eof the carnival so no one gets lost\r\n\r\n## Visiting the carnival\r\n\r\n> A slow, deep shuddering and fluttering of the veils of The Unspooling occurs from time to time. And each time it does, the 'curtains' flap dangerously close to the carnival, nearby towns, and various research encampments.\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- Religion/shrines ([Operatus Captival], [The Final Next], [The Hushed Partition], and of course [The 214th Isotoxal Compact])\r\n- Carnivals (dart games, weird rides, tents of mystery, and weird food)\r\n- Tour groups\r\n- Dangerous areas of strong 'truth warping' (reversed gravity, unmaking, life-creation, cube-slicing, and matter sculpting)\r\n- Researchers ([Remora] refiners, [VDC] headhunters, and university grad students)\r\n\r\n### Oleald visitors\r\n- [The Lantern-Headed God] (in an alley)\r\n- [Profane Gyamtso] (imprisoned by [Format Svae], and being paraded around)\r\n- [The Shell] (being pulled in by The Unspooling)\r\n\r\n### The Unspooling begins to expand\r\n- (should happen only a little after the players have gotten settled)\r\n\r\n> One of the curtains sloughs off, like an onion skin, and hurtles down towards you.\r\n> \r\n> Up close, it rushes down and forward at an incredible pace, and SLAMs down upon you before there's even a moment's notice.\r\n> \r\n> Silence. A deep fog has covered everything, and you can barely make each other out amid it.\r\n> \r\n> (based on Passive Perception) You begin to make out something peculiar before you. A hand, no, hands floating disembodied in the air. New ones seem to sprout from behind the old, and grab each others' wrists. They form a simple ring. Then more unfurl out. A hole made of hands. They expand, covering the extremities of your vision and your hearing. Sensory perception fails. And what is left behind is a small figure. Frail, with long, LONG flowing black hair covering its eyes. And Voquev Vehirit stands up before you.\r\n\r\n- [Voquev Vehirit] commandeers their bodies\r\n  - Roven / Wyvil: \"It's me you've been looking for. It's always just been me.\"\r\n  - Violet: \"You're going to die in a few days. Make it to me, and that won't happen.\"\r\n  - Caius: \"I accept. I'm ready to deal.\"\r\n  - Nohr: \"I know what you want. Free me, and your word will be as truth.\"\r\n  - Enya: \"How do you know your family is real? If you want to make sure that they stay that way, you'll come aid me.\"\r\n\r\n- People begin darting towards The Unspooling\r\n- Some in groups, some individual\r\n- They begin to come in large masses behind you, and you feel yourselves falling into line ahead of them\r\n- Ahead, a line of people. They are armed, they are shouting, and they are refusing entrance to any that come close\r\n\r\n## Fighting [Leyaprac, Standing Tall, Holding Fast, Unshaken]\r\n\r\n> You're at the head of this rushing crowd, running at full speed towards a fearsome line of armoured guards and monks. Before you, the wall of soldiers cries out: \"Leyaprac! Standing Tall! Holding Fast! Unshaken!\". Your crowd collides with theirs, pushing, straining, reaching to get to the other side; to The Unspooling.\r\n\r\n[Initiative tracker](https://dm.tools/tracker)\r\n\r\n- Stats\r\n  - 2x Gladiator (Leyaprac Shieldbearer)\r\n  - 4x Bandit (Leyaprac Warden)\r\n  - 1x Cult Fanatic (Leyaprac Fortifier)\r\n- Leyaprac death\r\n  - When Wardens die, they produce a 5ft wall of flesh and red crystal. All creatures within the wall take 2d8 piercing damage\r\n  - When Shieldbearers die, they produce a 15ft wall of flesh and red crystal.

You float momentarily, before being slammed back down. The ground beneath your feet crunches, now inexplicably entirely made of glass.\r\n\r\n- At the start of each round, roll on the [Random Unspooling Events] table\r\n\r\n## Within the 'Event Horizon' / the world starts to peel back\r\n\r\n> You step beyond the fallen bodies and crytaline towers of the Leyaprac soldiers and make your way forward.\r\n> \r\n> Ahead, the curtains of The Unspooling seem to part for you, fluttering gently, even with no wind around to be felt. Stepping through them feels like stepping out of a sauna; into something fresher and more real than the muggy consciousness you left behind.\r\n> \r\n> You've been walking for hours. Or has it been minutes? Has it been both? By now, all recognizable landmarks have been completely stripped away. Crumpling and floating away like paper caught on the breeze. In their place rise high, ominous mountains, and the landscape is covered with strange lichens, dead bushes, and above you sit stars that none of you recognize.\r\n> \r\n> Ahead of you, through the haze, you begin to spot other figures.\r\n\r\n### Individuals with truths\r\n- Love-stricken person: they and [Voquev Vehirit] would be perfect romantic partners\r\n- Combatants: they are going to die tomorrow\r\n- Bloody person: they have a cancer in their stomach\r\n- Celestial: they can see now, and are completely overwhelmed by it\r\n- Nameless person: keep losing and regaining different names\r\n\r\n> Every one of these individuals, including yourselves, seem to be shuffling towards some destination. It is The Only Place To Go. You know this. And at the center of both physical and mental paths which you now take, lies a singularity. A place of infinite darkness, gravity, concept, and truth. The point of no return. The unstoppable force *and* the immovable object. As you fall into the pit alongside the other marchers, your bodies pile on top of each other, and your mind is squeezed, as sand through a seive, beyond some primitive reality.\r\n\r\n- Question for the whole party: \"How does it feel to become unshackled from truth?\"\r\n\r\n## Getting to the 'Singularity' / final cliffhanger\r\n\r\n> THUNDER! YOU'RE FALLING A MILLION MILES A MINUTE! THE AIR RUSHES PAST AS THE VACUUM OF THE SPARCE PRESSES IN ALL AROUND YOU. ABOVE YOU THE HOLE FROM WHICH YOU JUST FELL PUCKERS AND BLOSSOMS INTO A THOUSAND TINY EYES THAT WEEP AS YOU LEAVE. YOU'RE UNDER YEIMA. LITERALLY UNDERNEATH IT. FLOATING AND FALLING AND TUMBLING OUT INTO THE VAST EMPTY VOID. THE UNSPOOLING'S CURTAINS DRAPE OFF THE GREAT PLANE LIKE INVASIVE VINES. HOW DID IT EVER GROW SO LARGE? YOU. LOOK. DOWN.\r\n> \r\n> A GREAT FORM STRETCHES BELOW YOU, UNDER YEIMA. A DARK, ALL-ENCOMPASSING NAKED BODY THAT BLENDS IN AND OUT OF THE STARS. IN AND OUT OF YOUR PERCEPTION. IN AND OUT OF REALITY. IT'S SO BIG THAT TURNING YOUR HEAD TO SEE AND HEAR IT ONLY PROVIDES YOU WITH MORE GLIMPSES OF ITS GRANDEUR. AND IT HAS A FACE. AND IT'S LOOKING AT YOU. AND CLASTER VEYEIMALL, WAKENING GOD OF EMOTION, BORN AND DEAD UPON THE SHORE SPEAKS TO YOU. IT'S TERRIBLE, WHAT IT CONFIDES IN YOU. IT MAKES YOU WANT TO CRY AND SCREAM AND DIE AND LAUGH. AND YOU TUMBLE, BROKEN ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO ITS GASPING MOUTH.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n- Players watched a [Format Iera] procession go by, carrying [Profane Gyamtso]\r\n  - They were somewhat sympathetic, but couldn't do much\r\n- Players visited an axe-throwing carnival game.

This means that if they (the player) try to do something, it may go their way (various luck checks to determine effectiveness)\r\n- The lack of truth is making certain party members split a little bit\r\n\r\n### **Violet** in **Anger room**\r\n- In an upside-down medbay\r\n- As violent flashes and explosions rage outside, gurneys are wheeled in, the bodies of which grow increasingly enraged\r\n- In the stained-glass on the walls, there are portraits of [The Fisher King]\r\n- **Note:** Violet's Hag has begun to emerge a lot more, almost as if it's being strained out of her\r\n\r\n> You open the door, and step out, impossibly, into a corridor. It's a standard crewmember access corridor, one that could be found on any freight or harvest starship. There are doors running down either side, each with a name plate on it. There are also portholes on the opposite wall. At the far end of the corridor is a singular, unmarked door.\r\n\r\n### **Caius** and **Enya** in **Curiosity room**\r\n- On a loading dock, stacking boxes and filling out inventory forms\r\n- The boxes are labelled with notes that designate different body parts from [Claster Veyeimall]\r\n- There is a large sooty mark on one wall, remnants of where \"[The Fisher King]\" \"ascended\"\r\n- **Note:**\r\n  - Caius's jar cuts through false realities, reasserting truth in various ways\r\n  - Enya's god ([Yyenwid Arwa]) may show up, chastising her for  not cleaning up the sooty mess. She appears... wrong\r\n\r\n### **Blum** in **Apathy room**\r\n- Monotonously shovelling great heaps of Remora into tall furnaces\r\n- The furnace is exposed to The Sparce, as crystalline Remora figures are the ones on either side that shovel and are consumed\r\n- At the far back of the furnace, an effigy of [The Fisher King] can be found. It is both living and dead. It is being punished, somehow\r\n- **Note:** He may think that the surrounding figures are looking at him. This triggers flashbacks to the Primordial and [Alhammarret Aum]'s lives. WIS save to holt it together. Low roll = Alhammarrat transformation, medium roll = Wyvil transformation\r\n\r\n### **Nohr** in **Joy room**\r\n- In a communications hub room, with sinuous strands running in and out of ports\r\n- The strands need to be cauterized or otherwise mended before being plugged back in\r\n- Each time one is, joyous scenes flash in their head (receiving rejuvenation from Frubsh Gomphera -> helping wayward souls -> looking at the stars)\r\n- **Note:** After some time, their presence is noted, and like white blood cells, all of the other operators will begin to turn on her. When this happens, [The Fisher King] emerges from the darkness on one side. They are draped in cables and plugged into the wall\r\n\r\n## Making their way to each other\r\n- They must go through the various rooms of the ship to find each other\r\n- [The Fisher King]'s presence is felt in each room (e.g. in artwork as a god, as an NPC, destruction left in their wake, etc.)\r\n- Each porthole on the ship shows a different view\r\n  1. A view of stars. As a starship flies past in the distance, the stars billow out behind it in waves.\r\n  2. A view out the window of a high Yeiman spire. down below, the land of the plane slopes out, then curves up high above like a dome.\r\n  3. A stone wall.\r\n  4. A mirror, with various objects in it not reflected in the 'real' world (light fixtures, another mirror, icons of [The Fisher King], etc.)\r\n  5. The Mortar, but with each asteroid floating in a raging, frothing sea.\r\n  6. A dusty, abandoned workshop, with a single Construct sitting on a shelf. It has a single blinking light.\r\n\r\n### Jealousy room\r\n- A large chapel, build onto the spireside on Yeima\r\n  - Large fluttering curtains, reminiscent of the layers of The Unspooling\r\n  - Incense burns, and birds can be heard chirping outside\r\n- Multifaith Isotoxal church, with all of the icons removed\r\n- At the head of the large room kneels [The Fisher King]. They are dead and desecated, draped in Sacrosanct's robes, and are kneeling with head bowed\r\n  - Every once in a while, a member of the congregation sneaks up, cutting a piece of their flesh and scampering off with it. In the corner, the other parish members squabble for the scraps\r\n  - The flesh regrows quickly\r\n\r\n### Love Room\r\n- The door opens up from a hatch on the deck of a small boat\r\n- [The Fisher King] is there, casting their nets out into the semi-Sparce\r\n  - They are at peace. They love their work\r\n  - They will ask any question asked of them, but have no memory of the capturing events\r\n- The air may be difficult to breathe for some of the party members\r\n- After some time, something big gets caught\r\n  - The line is reeled in, and it kicks and bucks\r\n  - Eventually the catch stops thrashing and what is pulled up is [The Fisher King]'s own dead and bloated body\r\n  - Covered in Remora and barnacles\r\n- They begin to freak out, scream, and the world and scene unfurl around everyone\r\n\r\n## Encountering Voquev Vehirit and Claster Veyeimall in Fear room\r\n- There used to be a reality here, but Vehirit removed it\r\n\r\n> You are now met with sudden quiet. In this 'room' there are no lights, no objects, no people. It is just floor and dull grey sky. An ambient gloomy light permeates the space, just enough to make each others' features out (like at dusk). In the centre of the room are two figures.\r\n> \r\n> Voquev Vehirit is one of them. She sits cross-legged, assuming a diminutive, resolute form, crafted from ten thousand shifting grains of rice and sand. She's barely holding herself together.\r\n> \r\n> In her lap lies the head of Claster Veyeimall. The rest of its body extends out before her, half dissolving into the ground. Its corpse is *crawling* with a small writhing mass. It looks to you, and tries to speak but only colours come out.\r\n\r\n- Vehirit explains the situation\r\n  - [The Fisher King] has snared her sway over truth, and has untethered it from reality\r\n  - Truth =/= reality\r\n  - They have weaponized it, and have forced Veyeimall into form\r\n  - Veyeimall's corpse upon the shore is being brought into the stable reality\r\n  - Vehirit has been forced into the role of Helm, and Veyeimall into the role of starship\r\n  - If they want to stop [The Fisher King], they need to wrestle control of Veyeimall from them using the 'ship''s 'helm'\r\n  - Vehirit will not be able to hold back when in the Interspace\r\n- Vehirit gives them the key to the Bridge (it doesn't exist)\r\n\r\n## Fight inside the Helm\r\n- The party must make it to the end of the corridor and onto the Bridge\r\n  - The party must link into the helm\r\n\r\n> The world melts away from your eyes and ears like melting glass or streaking rain. Some of you who have flown in starships may be familiar with this sensation. For others, it's an extremely disorienting moment, before the world reasserts itself again. You're standing in what seems to be a large, empty amphitheatre. All the seats have been removed, and the whole of the room is draped in concealing white fabric. Like snow stuck to every surface, the landscape is strange and alien.\r\n\r\n^images/unspooling/andro.png^\r\n^images/unspooling/gyno.png^\r\n\r\n- Enemies\r\n  - Voquev Vehirit (Gynosphinx)\r\n  - Claster Veyeimall (Androsphinx)\r\n- Vehirit has one legendary action to cause a [Random Unspooling Event|Random Unspooling Events]\r\n- Veyeimall has one legendary action to for a party member to (on their turn) (d8 drop the 8):\r\n  1. Attack one of their allies\r\n  2. Become afraid of Veyeimall\r\n  3. Attempt to steal an item from a party member\r\n  4. Make no damage-dealing attack\r\n  5. Move close to Veyeimall\r\n  6. Begin laughing uncontrollably\r\n  7. Protect Veyeimall for one turn\r\n\r\n> Vehirit crumples, unspooling like thread. Her flesh expands and changes, running under the white fabric in the room. It peels back to reveal faded carpets, dusty wall sconces, and worn floorboards.\r\n>\r\n> Veyeimall stumbles, getting caught in the carpets and fabric.

The largest ones lie prone or supine, half sunken amidst the sands. Their eyelids are perpetually wakening slits. Other, smaller figures are frozen in rising or standing positions. The water washes about their ankles, and sand cakes in their eyes and ears. Finally, the smallest ones of all the figures lie dead. Crumpled, missing arms or heads, splayed out in final death throes.\r\n\r\n- Setup\r\n  - All around them are the awakening bodies of [Claster] gods, rising bodies of [Voquev] gods, falling bodies of [Yyenwid] gods, and uncountable amounts of dying [Oleald] gods\r\n  - Far, far above, something dark is already thundering away\r\n  - [Vehirit] and [Veyeimall] kneel slumped before [The Fisher King]\r\n- Combat\r\n  - Each round, everyone rolls a DC 16 Wisdom save.

While their comrades, other beings on [the shore|The Shore] had stood and rose to follow the shore, Veyeimall had waited and wondered. For, unlike their contemporaries, they were conflicted. Troubling and puzzling thoughts had come to them as a result of a swirling interior turmoil of emotion. They wanted to follow their kin; to take in the beauties of life and of being, but for some reason or another, they simply couldn't bring themselves to do so. Too many distracting feelings, too many worries, too many distracting things right here and now. And so Veyeimall waited. And sat. And thought.\r\n\r\nIn time, they grew weary, burdened down by so many multiplying emotions. They sagged their head, and let out a deep breath, letting it wash out to sea. It wasn't too long before a small figure started to wade back in with the rising tide. It had been given life by the breath, and given time to grow. Veyeimall reached down into the sandy shore and carefully scooped up the small creature. The tiny thing, no bigger than Veyeimall's own thumb, steadied itself as it rose. When they had lifted it up nearly to chest level, they stopped, and stared curiously down at it. And so Wrath spoke:\r\n\r\n\"I know what ails you, but I won't tell you.\" said Wrath, gnawing furiously at Veyeimall's cuticles.\r\n\r\n\"Why not? Tell me at once pest!\" they thundered.\r\n\r\nThe small one merely scampered about all over the comparatively large palm, poking, slashing, writhing at it. Veyeimall scoffed furiously, and at once devoured the small being, chewing with satisfaction. With a singular gulp, they swallowed. But the tiny meal was far from satisfactory, and Veyeimall was left more confused than ever. They had thought that by devouring Wrath that they might in turn be filled with sudden purpose and vigor. This was apparently not the case. Shaken by this unsatisfactory turn of events and the unsightly deed that they had just committed, Veyeimall's eyes drooped, their toes curled, and their body wracked with great sobs. One particularly large tear fell to the sand, directly beside where they were sitting. It seeped into the shore, and mingled with the waves as they lapped. In time, in the place where the droplet had landed, another small form began to appear. It pulled itself up from under the wet sand, and stood huddled and shivering. Veyeimall, taking sudden notice of the new being, moved their hand and held it above the creature so that no further drops would fall and possibly hit it. And so Grief spoke:\r\n\r\n\"I know what ails you, but I won't tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't? What is it with you small ones and your riddles?\" they croaked. They had stopped crying by now, but still sat melancholically.\r\n\r\nGrief merely stared up, struggling to find any more words. It wavered, and toppled over, its small form crumpling on the shore. Veyeimall pitied the tiny one, and so in the hopes of alleviating some of its pain, reached down and picked it up by the arm. They lowered Grief into their mouth and swallowed without chewing. Grief did not taste as good as Wrath had. Now alone again, they leaned back and stretched, shuddering and lying still. As they sat in the sand, quiet and confused, something small and wriggling tumbled out from the hair atop their head. It rolled down their brow, bounced of their nose, and fell flat on Veyeimall's forearm. Too stunned to move or speak, Veyeimall peered down at this next new arrival. It slowly pulled itself up, and began prancing along the forearm. And so Jubilation spoke:\r\n\r\n\"I know what ails you, but I won't tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am beginning to expect this. And yet the more of you that I speak to, the less I understand.\"\r\n\r\nJubilation merely jumped and twirled about on Veyeimall's arm. The small thing nearly lost its balance once or twice, but quickly righted itself. After some time, it collapsed exhausted into the nearest palm. Veyeimall, sensing the oncoming and uncomfortable pattern shrugged slightly, and smooshed the tiny being between their palms. They quickly ate what remained there. Jubilation tasted horrible, and they were quite taken aback at how awful it was. Tired now from all the ruckus and riddles, they closed their eyes and leaned back to lie along the shore for a while. It had not been but a moment after Veyeimall's eyes closed when they felt a flittering gust tumble all about them. The breeze wafted and trembled in the air, and all at once faded. Opening their eyes ever so slowly, they spied once again a small being. This time it was seated cross-legged and arms outstretched, square in the middle of their chest. Veyeimall was surprised, but didn't move, worried that they might disturb the seated creature. And so Love spoke:\r\n\r\n\"I know what ails you, but I won't tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I still don't understand what you mean to say. The more answers I seek, the more questions arise. I am tired, and I am empty. But, after at all, I think that that's okay. I've learned more sitting here in thought than I would have if I started following my kin. I'm grateful that I stayed. And I thank you.\" they said.\r\n\r\nEver so gently, Veyeimall scooped the fragile seated figure up into their palm, and ate it whole. Love was tough, and extremely hard to digest. It tasted the absolute worst of all, and nearly made Veyeimall sick. Despite all of this, it was the best meal that Veyeimall had ever eaten, and would soon become their favourite food. They sat thinking for a little while longer before finally, ever-so-slowly, getting up and starting to stumble along the shore.","Tags":["myths and stories","The Sparce","private","The Awakening of the Gods","The Shore","Claster Veyeimall"],"TaggedBy":[]},{"Title":"Vishma, the Seven Seer","Body":"Seven eyes along her back and chest remained vigilant, even if they were ornamental.
