# 🌌 The Flow

{⚫ The Sparce,🌐 The Pantry,❗ featured articles,📍 locations}

The shifting tides and currents when permeate [⚫ The Sparce]. Invisible to the untrained eye, but the leylines and flowing routes for many natural phenomenon:
- Animal migratory routes
- Magical hotspots
- Void storms
- Asteroid belts and star nurseries
- Pocket dimensions
- [🪨 Remora] fields

Due to their natural importance, these currents also became important to non-natural factors (one way or another):
- Trade routes
- Swift [starship|🚀 starships] passage
- Settlements

*The glittering bands and winding channels of The Flow extend out beyond you. It curves gently, as if blown or pulled by some gentle lapping force. In its ""waters"" flow thousands of tiny shining Remora crystals and small Sparce fish.*
