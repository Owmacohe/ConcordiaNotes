# Player house rules

{ðŸ›‘ rules}

## **Combat**

- Cantrips can be cast as bonus actions, but your antagonists can and will do this too.

## **Death / 0HP**

- When you hit 0 HP, roll on the following table:
^images/0_hp_table.png^
- When you make death saving throws, you remember a memory from your life.
- Death saving throws are made privately by the DM.

## **Character creation**

- For each negative attribute you apply to your character (*e.g.* physical impairment, irrational fear, enemies, etc.), you can also apply a positive one (*e.g.* extra feat, starting item, extra language, etc.) (max 2-3). ***PLEASE SPEAK WITH ME IF YOU INTEND TO DO THIS. PENDING APPROVAL AFTER TRYING IT OUT IN-GAME.***
- You may reroll stats or change starter items once before the start of the third session. After that, it's locked in.
- When adding health when levelling up, either: roll your hit die *(reroll 1s)* or simple add half your hit die. *Don't forget to add CON modifier.*

## **Other**

- Dice that roll off the table are immediate crit failures / lowest possible damage. *This does not include death saving throws*
- Respect verbal and somatic casting requirements.
- You can cast spells when you're out of spell slots by spending 2 points of exhaustion per spell level. *(doing so will not kill the player)*
- Fall damage is affected by creature size:
   - Tiny = 1d4 / 10ft
   - Small = 1d6 / 10ft
   - Medium = 1d10 / 10ft
   - Large = 1d12 / 10ft
   - Huge = 1d10 + 1d6 / 10ft
   - Gigantic = 1d20 / 10ft
