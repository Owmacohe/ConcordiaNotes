An ancient, massive [Kromacvin] [demigod|Oleald], kept secret far beneath the earth of [Singular City] on [⏳ Krom]. They are one of the oldest living beings in all the [🌐 The Pantry], and the prime source of greater prophecies for [The Foretellers Enclave]. They were born in [pc103|Passage Consideration].

Due to their enormous size, unstable mutagenic form, and maddening foretelling, they are kept out of public view, and worshipped from afar.

Though knowledge of Cyr was much more widespread during the [Aetivima Period] and the early [Taqadum Period], their mention has since been regulated outside of Krom.
