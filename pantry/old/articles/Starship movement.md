# Starship movement

{üõë rules}

[üöÄ starships] can be moved through the void of [‚ö´ The Sparce] by harnessing the power of raw intellect through [üß¢ ship helms]. The higher level the helm, and the heavier [weight|üìè ship weights] of the ship, the more intellect is required to move it at a fast pace. Any sentient being can operate a helm, but only those with sharp wits and training can do so effectively, and for long periods of time. Ships use [Fathoms]/hour (fph) as units of movement.
