# Guarmiel the Lamb

{Crystal Ship NPCs,The Hyacinth House,Celestials,ðŸ”’ private}

Rumoured to be celestial royalty, or what version that might be. His body was chimeric, with two heads of a lamb on each shoulder of a crooked man. Any possible life of royal prophecy was seemingly left behind long ago. He was very quiet and a sullen figure, who guided [Brahmiel (Brahm)] academically and through the many woes of being a young boy.

Left in the middle of the night on [ðŸ’€ Reht] after speaking cryptically with Brahm.
