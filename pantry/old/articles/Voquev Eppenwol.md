# Voquev Eppenwol

{ðŸ˜‡ gods,Voquev,Claster Gaiyadri}

## **God of:** Plains

## **Godly description**
The true godly earner of plains-wise majesty. It is said that Voquev Eppenwol initially rejected their entitled deity forms, choosing instead to walk their domain, and earn their right. The legend continues to proclaim that they walked for six-hundred and eighty-nine afternoons and pleasant evenings, the same time that it takes for the soul of a rabbit to depart its warren after death. After this long journey, they sat in contemplation for two-thirds of one second, and decided to accept the mantle after all. It is for this reason that they are greatly respected.

Great masses of worshipers, scholars, and consorts followed Voquev Eppenwol during their voyage. These would eventually become great beasts and grasses as they also joined into the realm cloak. Three wood nymphs stay by the god's side however, and these would become the first protectors of the hidden Valley Circles. Though, that is a story for another time.

## **Physical description**
As they were passing along their journey, they plucked daisy-flowers, coyote's feet, and pine grass from the ground underneath them. With these (and other) treasures, they enshrouded themselves in a great and living cloak of the realm. As they passed, the cloak's train picked up more and more, and eventually became a part of the land itself. It has never since been separated.
