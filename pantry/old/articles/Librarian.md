A fleshy, pale, animated mass of stalks and skin, conjured and directed by a trapped fragment of a dead [Oleald] soul. Through a process requiring consent, fractions of the demigod's essence is captured before the main bulk returns to [ðŸŒŒ The Flow] and is [reincarnated|Life after death]. These non-living, non-dead creatures perform menial tasks, and can live for many years before their flesh and stalks must be rebound.

They are fabricated solely by [The Hinengaro Registry] and [The Hushed Partition].
