# Chemical warfare on Yadri

{Yyenwid Ompos,‚õ∞Ô∏è Yadri,Aetivima Period,üìÖ events}

***[Date: pc893|Passage Consideration]***

In the beginning of the [Aetivima Period], when inter-[planar|üåç planes] warfare had yet to become ""civilized"", many great atrocities were played out. They were brought on by mad and hungry [üòá gods], revelling in newfound destructive purposes.

One such massacre was the experimentation of bio-chemical warfare and weaponry, designed by [Yyenwid Ompos]. Targeted blight magic was hurled upon the surface of [‚õ∞Ô∏è Yadri], killing nearly 70% of its mortal population. The massacre was so deadly that for the following 547 years, its mention was forcefully expunged from all record and memory.

Many of the great craters where the chemicals fell still mark the plane's surface, most of which were naturalized and turned into lakes by the surviving [Giant|Giants] populations around the year pc1,440.
