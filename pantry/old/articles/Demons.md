# Demons

{üßë races,‚ù§Ô∏è Yeima,Playable races}

Demons are at once tactful diplomats and raging warlords. Their plethora of subraces mirror a range of seven emotions (Love, Joy, Curiosity, Apathy, Jealousy, Fear, Anger). Demon societies are rigidly structured into hierarchies, with the 'happy' emotions always on top. While popular misconception attributes negativity to the lower castes of Demons, most are incredibly individualistic, and rely only mildly on their emotional designation. On [‚ù§Ô∏è Yeima], Demon society is structured into these seven distinct groups, each governing themselves in a precarious balance. There's no apartheid per se, but classes tend to stick to themselves. However, none of these divisions are portrayed in [‚ù§Ô∏è Yeima]'s inter-[planar|üåç planes] presence. All embassies, outreach programs, and promotional media mandates the equal representation and presence of Demons of all subraces.

Demons are born with Green skin, but change through Yellow, Orange, Red, Purple, and finally Blue during their lifetimes. Their skin is extremely sensitive just like their emotions, and as such, they will often receive many small scars across their bodies as they age. These scars will initially heal green, but will shift up to blue, mimicking their species' natural skin tone shift.

Demons possess a strange magic quality which allows them to perceive strong emotions related to their particular subrace in individuals, but only if they have formed a 'pact' with said person. Pacts come in many forms, and are often tailored to the individuals in question. Pacts are not reversible, and can be risky if performed between two Demons. As such, inter-Demon pact-making is generally frowned down upon on [‚ù§Ô∏è Yeima].

If a Demon makes enough pacts (usually an extremely high number) with a particular being, they begin to lose their sense of self, and even corporeal form. In time, and with more pacts, their very mind and essence may take up residence inside the other's body and brain, fully immersed in emotion and thought. This 'possession', while rare, can be extremely devastating, for both the demon and their host.

Demons typically live between 100-120 years.

*Players' note: Use the Tiefling race if playing a Demon.*
