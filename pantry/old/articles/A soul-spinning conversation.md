One low sullen evening, only but 206 ages since the last Claster had become dust, [Voquev Zephyriah] and [Voquev Tieraal] were walking along the shores of time, as they were oft to do. The two were quite used to each others' company, as they spend many evenings together, in contemplation. Among other deeds. They had become acquainted purely on a formal basis, but quickly grew close, which confounded many of their peers (especially [Voquev Gol'iead], who thought themselves to be much closer to the god of The Wind than many others). No matter the muttering and the whispering of the other [Following Gods|Voquev], Zephyriah and Tieraal still took many such marches as they swapped stories and prose.

This time however, Zephyriah had arrived bearing a proposition which they had been chewing on, both morally and literally. The concept was posed thus:

""Imagine a sweet smell. Let it waft from you"" said Zephyriah.

""It is done"", said Tieraal, who chose their words carefully when speaking.

""What does it remind you of?"" asked Zephyriah.

""Deep and low shuddering, and a catalyst of new sprouts"" proclaimed Tieraal.

""Ah yes, I can smell it too. Though it reminds me more of a hitching gust of blown sand.""

""Your words are spun well, my kin.""

""Perhaps. Though perhaps I am spun from them.""

""Perhaps.""

30 days passed between the gods' last and next footfall, and in this time, Tieraal had formulated a proper response. They asked: ""If you are spun from your words, then what I am spun from?"" At this particular moment, Zephyriah was in the process of commanding 6,432 air elementals in a great and terrible siege against the fortress walls of [Claster Veyeimall]'s rotting corpse, in which hordes of [Demons] had begun to take root. It was for this reason that they were only slightly preoccupied, and gave an unthinking answer.

""You are spun from silence. It is for this reason that we are so well acquainted.""

""I am spun from what I choose to be spun from. Silence is just the most comfortable"" said Tieraal, reluctantly.

""Not for me,"" said Zephyriah. The siege had ended, and they had quieted their kingly aspects.

""Perhaps you are correct then. I'm fortunate to know one so differently spun.""

""As am I.""

The two deities continued walking in silence, before parting ways at a 9th-dimensional dive-bar, and never thought of the conversation again. A passing scribe however, had fervently recorded the entire conversation in scripture, and immediately began distributing it en masse. Over the next 40 or so years, this short poem about soul-spinning would form the basis for 6 major world religions, before falling out of popularity and renown. It would still be another 9,000 uncountable ages before the death of The Following Gods, and the birth of [The Falling Gods|Yyenwid].
