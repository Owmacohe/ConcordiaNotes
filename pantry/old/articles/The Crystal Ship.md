## **Physical description**

A strange, oblong [starship|🚀 starships] made as an experiment by [The Sparcian Commonwealth], but seldom used until picked up by [the party|Crystal Ship PCs]. Almost teardrop-shaped in appearance, with a pointed front end and a bulbous back end. In combat, its front end splits open, revealing 8 articulated hydraulic arms which are used to grapple other ships, or manipulate large objects in zero-gravity.

The engine, though not requiring room for a boiler or combustion area, is still large. While the [helm|🧢 ship helms] channels the raw mental energy of the [Helmsperson], the engine turns it into thermal energy. Mounted along the wall and ceiling, the engine is a mess of tubes and small combustion chambers. It recycles magically-infused liquid through its cycle, and uses this to evoke fire out of the exhaust.

*Though strange in its construction, the ship has a delightfully homey feel. Warm and muted colours decorate the interior, and the smell of old incense seems to worm itself everywhere. Though closely packed, the rooms are well furnished, and all seem to lead in towards the central common room. Its exterior paint coat is a standard industrial grey and orange, streaked here and there with Remora residue. It appears to only have been flown a few times.*
