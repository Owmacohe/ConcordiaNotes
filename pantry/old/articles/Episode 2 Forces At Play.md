> ""Follow the lanes. Get in, get out, and hit the hatchery vessel...  We can't let this continue for longer than it has. You all know the price for our inaction. Each day the Commonwealth gains influence out here... Respect the Charter. Fear the Convoke. The Regiment will hold.""

- Captain's log, expressing concern about senior members' tactical choices:

> ""Despite orders from above, I can't help but worry. In fifteen years, I've never been this close in. I can feel the presence of the planes, pushing on me. The crew can feel it too, I know. Those damn CWs have gone too far, colluding with the Convoke. No wonder the Founders cut ties. Yet still, such rashness, and so near Reht. It's worrying.""

- Scrambled and inaccessible black box (DC 13 to find)
 - Requires an engineering expert to decode (found either on-plane, or at a significant [The Sparcian Commonwealth] or [The Planar Convoke] location)
 - *Once decoded, it reveals a network of attack routes, safehouses, and outposts*

### **Landing on the Soetanto trading outpost / delivering goods / outpost market**
> [The Soetanto Trading Outpost] begins to come into view as you get within 10-15 fathoms or so. The operation itself is built into and around a large temple, itself situated large and sprawling on an asteroid (~1/10th the size of The Moon). As you get closer, small patches of encampments and minor towns can be seen along its surface, the largest of which is your destination. [The Crystal Ship] enters the atmosphere, and you make your way toward the town's large landing pad, which is in fact located in a wide courtyard at the centre of a temple. A massive array of communications spires, atmosphere producers, and metallic holy symbols are clustered in makeshift towers all over the temple's roof. The temple itself is made of pale grey and while stone, and is extremely simple in design (though quite spread out).

- Arrival at loading bay
 - Fully-packed landing strip
 - Mostly [⚓ freight] and [🪝 harvest] vessels
 - A few other, smaller ports cluster around the main terminal, where they land
- Conversation with [Cardamom]

 - Inquires about how small the shipment is, but thanks them nonetheless, saying that these outposts need to be held strong under [The Sparcian Commonwealth]
 - Provides info about the trade outpost
  - Age of the temple (since before the oputpost)
  - Strategic location (connected to all major routes and [Flow|🌌 The Flow] lines in [Soetanto] and [Bhava] provinces)
  - The temple provides universal [chit|💰 chits] compensation for all local residents, and acts as storage and distribution for the province's [Commonwealth|The Sparcian Commonwealth] branch

 - If obviously tampered:
  - [Cardamom] speaks with the party
  - She chastises them a bit, noting the importance of trust among servants of the cause
  - She lets them off the hook, but mentions that she'll let [Bran Hegan] know, and that the price will be reduced by 1/3
 - If not tampered:
  - She thanks them for their service
  - Pays them in full
 - If secretly tampered (DC 17 to notice):
  - She makes no mention of the tampering
  - Secretly contacts [Bran Hegan]
- Sends a spy to tail the party while they're off the temple grounds

> You exit the landing pad ear in the direction that [Cardamom] directs you. Passing through a short stone hallway, you come out on the exterior of the temple. Immediately you are struck with the business of the market. The landing pad was busy, but here, shops, caravans, and pedestrians clog the narrow streets and alleyways.

> The market extends out in all directions; a criss-crossing maze of covered streets. Beams of light stream down through holes in the tarps and thin fabric that hang over the jumble of bodies. You see mostly Humanoids, being so close to [💀 Reht], but as [The Soetanto Trading Outpost] is such a hub, there are folks from all around here, and goods from far and wide.

### **Ancient [Claster Eprehtt] temple/ruins**
- After some time, the party returns to the landing pad or is found by an assistant
 - The assistant leads them towards the records room, when they suddenly become separated

> You all turn a corner, and suddenly, the assistant is gone. There are no hallways leading off, and the current one just extends straight out in front of you.

- All hear a large clacking/slamming sound coming from far down the hallway
 - The follow it down, making group Perception checks (DCs 12 and 18)
 - Successful checks reveal more info about how to escape
 - Both successful checks mean an exit can be found
- The sound is louder closer to exits (only they can hear it)

> As you follow the sound, taking rights and lefts as best you can, it grows fainter and fainter. barely indistinguishable to even [Brahmiel (Brahm)]'s acute ears.

- If any of the previous perception checks were over 14, the details on the walls can be noticed

> All the while, you've been able to notice more details appearing in the walls. Ornate columns and thin, decorative lines span down the walls. Tiny decals of prostrate and thin figures clutter the spaces near and on the ground.

### **Fight and reward**
- Tomb of self-mummified worshipers
 - Statue in the centre
 - Mummified figures all around

> Making as best a guess you can as to the source of the sound, now reduced to barely a whisper of a click/crunch, you round another corner. Immediately, you turn into a vast cavernous space. A couple stories tall, this seems to be an internal atrium of sorts. Very few beams of light spill in from the spotlight above, illuminating tiles on the stone floor.

> At the centre of the room sits an enormous stone statue of a hunched figure. Nearly as tall as a double decker bus, the stone carving is cloaked, its face hidden from view, legs crossed, and palms resting folded. At the feet of the statue sits a large stone box of sorts, which seems to be built into the ground. All around the base of the figure and the box are carved small intricate runes in tight concentric patterns.

- Rune translations (Higher Speech aka Deep Speech)
> ""And Eprehtt said unto the beings of flesh: Ye Shalt Tumble From The Vantage Of Life, And Be Embraced By Death! And the flesh mourned their passing with reverence and solemnity. The Exhalted Claster found such ceremony to be amusing, and thus a new school of mortality was formed.""

> As your gazes rest at the statue's feet, a shocking scene jumps out. Three figures sit in its shadow; a [Human|Humanoids], a [Celestial|Celestials] (rotted smooth face, hole in chest), and a [Cayman Zoofolk|Zoofolk]. They are withered, heavily bandaged, and beautifully adorned with dusty necklaces and headdresses. They all sit facing the statue, with heads bowed.

- Touching one of the mummies or opening the box triggers the fight
- Mildly useless magic items in the box
 - Monocle of thick quartz to see 'hotspots' of death
 - 1d4 use, limited potency, life-giving wand (thin, petrified wood)

  - Half health (36), split between all 3 (12 each)
  - Half damage (1d6 + 3 bludgeoning and 1d4 necrotic)
 - Moths flit from corpse to corpse and animate them
  - Striking an un-animated mummy brings it to life
 - Ending a turn on any of the patches of light teleports the creature (monster or player) to another patch
 - Cool, fresh air immediately begins to flow in after it the mummy is defeated

### **Back to the ship**

### **Next jobs**

> We've heard tell of a few [Commonwealth|The Sparcian Commonwealth] ships disappearing off the coast of [⏳ Krom]. Vanishing into thin air. No wreck and no crew left to speak of. I can understand the apprehension at taking such a job, but you'll be payed hazard wages, and we'll hopefully be able to put this mystery behind us.
- **Pay: 200 CHT**
- On-ship episode, which eventually crash lands on a randomly-appearing demi-plane
- Turns into a beach/castaway episode
- Hidden arcane anchor under the water draws ships in
- Mystery as to who/what constructed it

> We've recently struck a deal with [The Remora Guild] for the exchange of research equipment. We need a crew to quietly deliver an atomic [🪨 Remora] clock between our [Sparce|⚫ The Sparce] research lab and [🌱 Druxe]. The device itself is valuable and experimental, so this needs to be kept under wraps.
- **Pay: 125 CHT**
- Ultrasonic vibrations of clock draws in space animals, which eat the ship
- Must be escaped/destroyed from within
- Small civilization trapped in its stomach

> Asteroid mining near the outer ring of [The Mortar] appears to have caused quite a stir among the local biologists and miners alike. Apparently there's a been a gold rush of rare plant materials coming out of the rocks, or so we're told. Everyone on this side of [⚫ The Sparce] is rushing in to get in on the action, so it'll be a competitive job. I even hear that the local [Convoke|The Planar Convoke] administration is running the event as a competition.
- **Pay: 50% of what you're able to collect**
