# Winding Road Eradication Report; Addendum XI

{📄 documents,⛰️ Yadri,Hīkoi Period,The Winding Road,Hathiyaar-Rakt Inc.}

Dear Mr. Yiufei,

It is with this letter that I must immediately and forcefully tender my resignation. Despite best efforts and your ample funding, myself and our liaisons within [Hathiyaar-Rakt Inc.] have been unsuccessful in eradicating or permanently diverting the course of [⛰️ Yadri]'s [Winding Road|The Winding Road]. Due to either an enchantment upon the land or the flagstones themselves, no attempts (either arcane or bombardment-based) have been effective. To speak frankly, the entire effort has been a fool's errand, and this is where our mutual financial cooperation must come to an end. On behalf of HRI, I wish you good health and prosperous future endeavours,

- Vaclarthek Elbuernen, Senior Operations Manager, Hathiyaar-Rakt Incorporated
