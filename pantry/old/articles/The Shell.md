An enormous, cast-off conch shell of some ancient [Sparce beast|🐟 Sparce wildlife] large enough for a city to reside within that migrates by the power of modified [starship|🚀 starships] technology. Due to its large size, its movement is very slow, and it makes full revolutions around [The Mortar] roughly every hundred years.

It's a common [⚫ The Sparce] shipping destination and near-orbit tourist destination for the [🌍 planes] that it passes. It is currently in position off the coast of [🌱 Druxe].

In [pc4,152|Passage Consideration], The Shell began experiencing mechanical failures, and was forced to temporarily become landlocked. The problem (a rare and untreated form of divine tampering) was discovered too late, and by the time technicians had begun to tackle it, the [starship|🚀 starships] had become enmeshed with its [helm|🧢 ship helms], and had gained sentience. It was legally grated personhood that same year as a [Construct|Constructs], and later as an [Oleald] (a move which surprised many, though some claim that The Shell had been conscious for some time before then). While under heavy religious and public safety sanctions, the ship can still sometimes be seen patrolling its usual routes, passenger-less and silent.
