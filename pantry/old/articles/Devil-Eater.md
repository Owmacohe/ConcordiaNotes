# Devil-Eater

{😇 gods,Oleald,Zoofolk,🧑‍🔬 figures,Aetivima Period,Yyenwid Modsiw,🐐 Aaliat}

A mammalian Zoofolk [Oleald] god, specifically of the species *Tasmanian Devil*, and one of the most feared assassins during the [Aetivima Period]. She was one of the only documented cases throughout history of the murder of a demigod.

Instead of being born with the blood of [😇 gods], it was given to her much later in life. [Yyenwid Modsiw] bestowed dark sorcery and profane faith upon her after the slaughter of most of her demi-plane during one of the many Aetivima conquests by [Demons] on [🐐 Aaliat].

She utilized her granted power to horrid ends, spilling death and assassination across many on [❤️ Yeima] (both those who deserved it and those who did not). She was killed by a coalition of pan-[Pantry|🌐 The Pantry] Oleald 50 years before the beginning of the [Taqadum Period] in [~pc2,250|Passage Consideration].

Ironically, it is said that she spent so much time on Yeima after her ascension to demigod-hood that she adopted the local accent.
