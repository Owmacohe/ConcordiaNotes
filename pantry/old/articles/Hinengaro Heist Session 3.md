**<u>NOTICE ABOUT THE EPILOGUE</u>**

### **Getting inside [The Central Archive]**

- Party 1 is being pursued by [Hinengaro|Hinengaro Heist NPCs] representatives
   - They take damage on one side, and a depressurization warning goes off
   - Appliances begin to shut down
   - Whoever is using the helm loses connection

> As the helm space dissolves in front of you, as the helmet itself retracts, the wide glass visor of the ship  opens up to an array of floating points in space; the lattice of the exterior of the archive. As you barrel towards it, starship blasts screaming past you, the very air around you seems to tremor, and snap.

- Party 2 starts tense, as they are passing through a security monitor towards a bent-open hole in space
   - They have arrived, posing as maintenance workers on [Kechok]'s behalf
   - So far, they haven't been met with much resistance, in fact, everything seems short staffed
   - They are given communication beetles, which affix themselves to their necks, and asked to relay their progress when they've finished adjusting the binding tether tension
   - Helm use to get inside

> As your borrowed starship glides out of the maintenance receiving bay, and into the archive proper, the enormity of the space truly opens itself up to you. You land on the floor of an enormous hangar, deserted, quiet, and infinitely tall. Far, far above you, floating pathways criss-cross like blades of grass, and glints of light, as if reflected on a mirror, dance around you.

- Back to party 1
   - The [False Key|False Keys] begins to manifest for each of them
      - They each get to choose what it looks like
      - However, it behaves in a paradoxical manner (the lock already being open, they being no lock at all, the lock unlocking the key, the key unlocking the self)
   - Space opens up before them, and they pass into the archive, crash-landing

- The groups unite

### **Meeting the local population**

- A devoted [Kromacvin] clerical order resides within, and they crowd about the two starships
   - The newest members were born here, the oldest on just before its construction 20-25 years ago
   - They aren't aggressive, and will help guide the players further if asked (though they're shy)
   - Clothed in flowing blue robes, similar to those worn by the Registry, but without sigils or markers. Plain cloth and training gowns
- Their society is formed of rituals of categorizing, containing, and navigating object within the archive brought to them by [The Hinengaro Registry]
   - They know only ritual, and think [Yyenwid Modsiw] to be the only god
- To transport, vertices within the folded lattice must be found, and through a painful ritual, unfolded
   - The deeper inside one gets, the harder it is to perform, and the longer one must wait after doing so
- The locals are wary of Hinengaro presence, and thus usher them through one such doorway

### **Making it through the archives**

- Before each jump can be made, a [riddle](PDFs/riddles.pdf) must be answered
   - The locals are immune due to their biological adaptation
   - As the party passes through, they are brought to a mini pocket dimension, where the cosmic eye of [Yyenwid Modsiw] watches them from above
   - Riddles are transmitted wordlessly to their heads

> **Wind**
> No one can hold me
> In their palms or sight;
> I scatter sudden clatter
> Far and wide.
> I want to hammer oaks
> With mournful might;
> Yes, I strike sky
> And scour countryside.

- The first archive they visit is the document archive
   - Rows upon rows of infinitely tall shelves, with racks
   - Local populace can be seen here and there stocking and organizing
   - Large crossroads nearby where The Self-Containing Ledger is kept
- [Cathrine] offers to come with them as a guide
- Moving on, their guide finds it difficult to open a door

> **Needle**
> What is it that‚Äôs blind with an eye in its head, but the Pantry its use cannot spare; spends all its life clothing the dead, but always itself is naked and bare?

- The second archive is the biological one
   - Maze of glass boxes in what feels like an underground facility
   - Some boxes larger, and here the ceiling rises up
   - A few local keepers, but far less than before
- In one of the areas that they pass through has within it a [Librarian], introducing a food supplement to a tank of ancient [üêü Sparce wildlife]
- This third jump is particularly difficult, and their guide even struggles for a moment
   - Opportunity to help them keep it open with a strength check

> **Fork**
> I‚Äôve stabbed more dead beasts than any man‚Äôs sword. I‚Äôm simple to craft, but I belong with a lord.

- The third archive is the technological & research-focused one
   - An enormous facility, with piping and staircases all about
   - Some areas are larger, like hangars, others are smaller like offices or labs
   - Signs pointing off to: Ongoing Research, Prized Collection,  Spell Experimentation, and Time Catalogue
- Only a single local can be found here, toiling away trying to order frozen moments of time
- The last jump is the hardest, and the guide can get the crack upon, but it requires some of the party members to hold it open to get through *(STR check DC 15)*

> **Candle**
> What is the sister of the sun, Though made for the night? The fire causes her tears to fall, And when she is near dying they cut off her head.

### **Final lock puzzle**

- Upon coming through, the door closes, but cracks splinter off into space, and hang there
- They are gathered at the tip of a teardrop-shaped room, with an elevated back half
   - In the far back is an enormous sheet draped over a 40ft-tall rectangular object
   - At the back is a luxurious bed, overflowing with blankets and pillows. So much so that they spill off onto the floor and level below
   - In the bed is [Prognost Caradil Yun], enfeebled
   - He awakens as they approach the bed
- Chance for someone to see through the enchantment
- Caradil brings them over to the painting, revealing that he never even started it
- As they talk further, he realizes why they're there
   - He knows that information is leaking in, and he wants out
   - In defence of his own skin (literally), he gets paranoid and defensive
- Reveal that the bed never existed, he's much taller and more emaciated, and that the artwork is in fact a series of body-spanning tattoos
- Combat ensues

### **Combat**

^images/TAG/caradil_fight.png^

- As his Reveal of Countenance happens, the presence of [Yyenwid Modsiw] briefly leaves him
   - Like this, he is shown to be completely totally vacant, both in mind and nearly in body

- [Dino (Prestidigious Hort)]
   - He's transported to the crowd of a kickboxing match where [Leilland] is fighting. She spots him during the fight, everything melts away, and she explains that he melded into her and lost his physical form. She's angry at him for not being there, as he swore to be
   - In the battlefield that he arose in, while the pull of death tries to keep him down
- [Emmaryn]
   - The [Florafolk] vines within them trying to coexist within the meat of the [Kromacvin] body. A struggle for sunlight and nutrients
   - A combined body, followed and cornered by their family in a trading port
- [Harrison Simpleman]
   - Being forced to fight in a summer games in his hometown
   - An angry cat is cornered behind his store, and it attacks him before running away
- [Jebedda Habilitas]
   - In a dingy [ü™® Remora] den, and the sensory overload is hitting
   - Trying to write an art critic take on a particular work, and failing to see any originality in it or any of the last years' work
- [K999/KIM]
   - At an awards ceremony for [Yyenwid Terneh], surrounded by many talented artists and figured, and no one will pay attention to her
   - A conversation between two processor systems within her 'brain'. One is asking more and more for a core memory file that can't be found
- [Ribley]
   - Lost in the woods of [Ytin], with dense foliage and strange creatures about
   - In the belly of a large cargo ship, starving and unable to scrounge any food
- [Svae Tsering]
   - An emotional childhood memory of fire, anger, and being pursued
   - Being trained by [Cormac Seadh], but unable to contain anger
- [Tavalath Lightoath]
   - Fighting with [Voquev Thimdeit] in a shattered asteroid ring. Their anger tries to take them out of the moment, but the god resists
   - In an infinite plane of grassy fields, as it starts to rain

### **Getting out**

- Opportunity to record the tattoos, take pictures, or perhaps even take his body
- His death releases a pulse that starts to unfurl the archive from inside
   - As this happens, different archives start to blend in, and with them, the locals
   - Even the flickers in and out, its movements erratic
- As it unravels, [Cathrine] appears, informing them that the folded structure is unwrapping, but it won't last for long
   - The natural mass equilibrium of the universe will push back against the expanding size, and squeeze it back down to natural size
   - However, she can send them anywhere they want to go in these moments as the archive's control points go spinning across [üåê The Pantry]
- They can choose to go to [Copra Almorr]
   - If they do so, they tumble out of space and onto the large circular table in a secret feast hall
   - Underworld kingpins gathered all around
   - The wealth of information gained by scrutinizing the tattoos will prompt the invention of new technologies, religions, and physical properties
   - Copra offers them their full sum, and a seat at his table

- **<u>Where does everyone go from there?</u>**

## **NPCs**
