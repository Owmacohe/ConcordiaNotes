# Cremor Credit Union

{🏢 companies,The Remora Guild,Aetivima Period}

A loose conglomeration of banks and loan shops that surfaced in the relatively 'civil' middle era of the [Aetivima Period]. It, as well as other bureaucratic measures were the catalyzing force for many civil disputes, leading to, thousands of years later, the birth of the [Taqadum Period].

Unlike many other predatory [🏢 companies] that fell in the wake of the Aetvima Period, Cremor underwent massive restructuring and publicization, becoming the foundational structure for [The Remora Guild]. Scholas debate to this date the possibly negative modern-day consequences of this development.
