# Yyenwid Ankno

{Yyenwid,ðŸ˜‡ gods,Voquev Ovetou}

## **God of:** Money/Wealth

## **Godly description**

A bloated lord of accumulation bureaucratically sifting through arcane ledgers of all transactions and material gain. A quiet, unassuming god, though filled with terrible power, unsated blood-hunger, and a terrible lack of remorse.

One of the principal [ðŸ˜‡ gods] responsible for the advancement of the [Aetivima Period] after the [Pre-Oleald Eons].

## **Physical description**

One of the myriad among gods, Ankno rarely takes physical form outside of the actual material possessions for which they represent. However, certain interpretations have been made of them, ranging from dark ichor wellsprings, regal felines with bodies of bone, to overgrown maniacal children.
