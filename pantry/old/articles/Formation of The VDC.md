# Formation of The VDC

{Yyenwid Anctu,VDC,📅 events,Taqadum Period}

***[Date: ~pc2,450|Passage Consideration]***

When [The 214th Isotoxal Compact] was still in the early days of its foundation (at the time it was in its 78th iteration), its highest [Sainthood] Sacrosancts were gifted with visions of [the divine|😇 gods]. Specifically, [Yyenwid Anctu] (and possibly [Yyenwid Ankno]) acted as holy arbiter of a great social and commercial project to form the [VDC].

Though the god's intentions with the [company|🏢 companies] branch were clouded and indirect, many attribute this simply as a attempt by the deity to strengthen their worship and material presence in [🌐 The Pantry]. It has been noted by many historical scholars as one of only a few instances in (relatively speaking) recent memory that a god has been so involved in mortal affairs.

The consequences of this have of course been the widespread proliferation of the Vividh Deitos Conglomerate across The Pantry in [Sparce|⚫ The Sparce] hubs, dense cities, and nearly all Compact houses of worship. Furthermore, it cemented the god as one of a few figurehead deities representing the core values of the Compact.
