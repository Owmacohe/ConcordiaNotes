An oddity of planes, Balx is a confluence of four [planar|🌍 planes] discs, each in constant war with the other. They float in [🌌 The Flow], attracted by each other's gravitational pull, and often crash into each other. When they do, violent conflict breaks out before the discs separate again. Each demi-plane's society is organized according to a [Format|The Balx Formats]; a cultural tradition and godly legacy. No one knows the original reason for the constant conflict, but few have investigated long enough to deduce it. The plane is nearly entirely closed off, its [pestle|🚪 pestles] long unattended.
