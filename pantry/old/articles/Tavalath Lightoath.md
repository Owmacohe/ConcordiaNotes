## **Backstory**

Male, appears to be 18 years old but actually 86 (spent 68 years travelling the astra sea -- I took the [Astral Drifter](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/background:astral-drifter) background) 

I am on this journey (with the party) because I am looking for Candles of the Deep (wondrous item; candles that cannot be extinguished when immersed in water). I learnt about them when on my travels through the astral sea and have returned to land to convert all of the candles encrusted into my form into this type of candle. 

I have a debilitating fear of water, because extinguishing the candles on my body causes me damage. 
I have this fear of water because of the wars raged against my people by the Format Uidi. 

I left my home Format on a nomadic journey through the Astral Sea to find peace and greater communion with my god, to discover inner peace, but still have an intense capacity for destruction, strength, and violence. Despite this, I try to find peace within my heart. 

During combat, I enter into communion with my god, entering a trance state (‚Äúrage‚Äù) in which I act from an out-of-body place. (just like the avatar state); I have next to no awareness of what is happening when I enter this trance. I always come down hard from these trance states, feeling both the whiplash of such an intense communion with the one I worship, while also feeling guilty for all of the destruction that I caused while I was not aware of my own surroundings. While on the material quest of transformation which can protect me from water, I am also on a quest for greater peace and pacifism. This is the reason why i left my home in the first place to wander the Astral plane. I am never more at peace than when I am having a perfect mug of tea, warming my hands.
