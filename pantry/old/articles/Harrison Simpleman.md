## **Backstory**

Harrison Simpleman is a half-giant half-halfling dude who averages out as a very human-looking, shape and size, boy-next-door. At night, he works as a barista at one of the townâ€™s average-sized taverns and has no real family besides his regular customers. During the day, he wanders about, foraging herbs for his brewed drinks. Heâ€™s working towards saving up to hopefully one day move to the Big Apple, New York City, where dreams are made. He gets his superstrength from his mother but he didnâ€™t follow in her footsteps of smashing things. Truth is, unlike everyone in his hometown, Harrison doesnâ€™t want to fight. He could, oh he definitely could if he wanted to. But he just wants to be left at peace in his little corner in the brewery, brewing his herbs, coffee beans, infusions, or whatever his next concoction may be to make his regulars feel better about their day.

One day, one of his favourite regular customers came to him with a proposition: she would pay him extra to accompany her on an adventure and to brew his concoctions for her on the road, to keep her in top shape in-between combats. Harrison had one condition before he said yes: he wonâ€™t be killing anyone or anything during these combats. He will just nurture, nurse, and heal.
