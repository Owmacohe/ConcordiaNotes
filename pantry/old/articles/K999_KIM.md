## **Backstory**

K999 is a 42 year old construct. Designed to be a fashion assistant of socialites she gained the attention of the fashion god Ye (Idk what his name is, but Iâ€™m going with Ye now) as K999 was accompanying one of her clients to a party where Ye was present. Ye was attracted to K999 and saw potential and a way to increase their popularity. 

K99 is short, only 1.57m and has had numerous procedures done to her lips, eyes, brow, jaw, cheek, breasts, abs, and most notably her ass. Where she previously sported a very curvaceous look she has recently slimmed down to slightly more realistic, yet still inhuman proportions.

K999 and Ye married and the wedding day was an extremely elaborate event. Having made an oath of devotion to Ye she promised to always look good and represent contemporary unaffordable streetwear for people that live in gated communities. Through a surrogate, Ye and K999 have four children North, Saint, Psalm and Pantry. All of them are incredibly ill-behaved and mostly raised by nannies.

K999 did elevate the work of Ye to world fame, but unfortunately, the couple divorced about two years ago. The lawsuit was a mess as Ye turned out to be a bit bipolar and K999 wanted full custody for the children she did not raise. After a year they eventually settled and shared custody and some resources. 

The divorce was a big blow for K999 as she is losing relevancy fast. She is desperate to keep her name relevant and her picture taken to hold on to her divine powers. Luckily she still has connections with a lot of high-profile people in entertainment. She is using this network to be spotted at as many events as possible. She is willing to do anything if it would bring her popularity.

She met the rest of the party at the tavern where she was promoting weight loss potions for a sponsor deal.
