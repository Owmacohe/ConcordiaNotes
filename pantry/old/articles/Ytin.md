# Ytin

{Florafolk,ðŸŒ± Druxe,Taqadum Period,HÄ«koi Period}

A minor sect of standard [Florafolk] culture on [ðŸŒ± Druxe]. While most of the plane's inhabitants participate in the tourism/luxury industry that they provide, incorporating their politics, traditions, and industry into it, some do not.

The followers of Ytin carry forward an ancient practice who's origins persist from the [Taqadum Period]. It is shaped by the belief that Florafolk exist not to serve (and leech from) their planar visitors, but to recuperate, heal, and enhance them physically. Naturally, Ytin practicers work closely with the [PCMAF] and [MacuCo]. Some members even undergo full symbiosis with biological life, living within them an beneficial parasites. This practice is rare, but has been kept alive for over 1,000 years.

Some scholars believe that Ytin was in fact the roots of the current service-based culture on Druxe, though this theory is highly politicized and is bound to draw criticism on the plane.
