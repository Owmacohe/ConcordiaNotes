# The Sodality of Miasma

{Yyenwid Sundhei,⛪ religions,Hīkoi Period}

A medical-aid-through-infection organization and religion focused on growing its ranks at any feasible cost in worship of [Yyenwid Sundhei]. Often regarded with anger, fear, and begrudging respect due to their miraculous healing abilities by infecting their patients with pollen shavings from their matron and spiritual guide [Their Grand Palpability Frubsh Ghomphera].

However ambitious, the organization does uphold the autonomy of the individual, and will not infect those who do not consent.

Though neutral in essence, the cult is banned from nearly every plane and [Sparce|⚫ The Sparce] port (though this is rarely more than a deterrent). This has caused them to produce a massive propaganda campaign in the effort to stabilize their public image. Though eccentric, it appears to be working.
