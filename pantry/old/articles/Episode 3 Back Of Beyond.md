## **Job description**

> We've heard tell of a few Commonwealth ships disappearing off the coast of [⏳ Krom]. Vanishing into thin air. No wreck and no crew left to speak of.

- Start exploring some character backstories
- Subversion of expectations, then further subversion
- Actual starship combat
- Final ethical choice(?)

## **Timeline/scenes**

### **Traveling (1st day)**

- Highest Perception roll wakes up
 - [Twis] is tripping out late at night
 - They have opened the [🪨 Remora] rations, and have had a fair sized dose
 - They accidentally knocked over a broom in the [Engine room]
 - [Reffiq] is sleeping in the far corner, and Twis says that they find him here sometimes, sleeping next to the humming machinery
 - They offer some Remora, and will continue conversation
 - They remark on how much each group doesn't know about the other
- After having their conversation and heading out, they stumble upon [Beets]

### **Encounter with [DIL] (2nd day)**

- He signals to the ship (comes through garbled in the static)
- His [Sparce|⚫ The Sparce] cows block the way, brushing up against the ship
- He comes by riding on a large one
 - The herd (10 adults, 3 calves) are pulling a large clay [starship|🚀 starships]
 - Gestures to be let in
- The cows drag the clay ship onto the hold
 - After [DIL] says its okay, the door on it opens
 - A small group of [Crumblekin] exit (4 adults, 8 children)
 - 10 more stay hidden in the ship
 - He says he's ferrying them to a nearby asteroid which he says they say is their home
 - They are harmless, and offer each party member a small clay doll
  - This will later grow into a fully-fledged [Crumblekin] in 1 week
- Says that he likes to check in on newcomers to the area, and that the cows need a grazing break (they lick off the Remora on the outside of the ship)
- He asks why they're heading this way, having not seen their ship before
 - Will point them in the right direction
 - He's heard some scattered communications off towards a nearby dwarf star
- Offers them some Sparce cow milk before leaving
 - Says that it cures all ailments, but he doesn't touch the stuff himself
- If I need to fill for more time, an [encounter|Random Sparce encounters] happens

### **Combat encounter / mounting tension**

> Following the directions that DIL gave you, you cautiously head out towards the nearby dwarf star. General ship audio chatter and distant station pings recede away, and your communications instruments grow silent. Up ahead, for those that can see it, the star looms every larger. By most standards, it's actually quite small, only about the size of an average planet, but its brilliant pale blue light still shines piercingly.

> After 10, 20, 30 minutes of approach, a small ping appears on the radar. Growing ever closer, it appears in fact to be a strange cluster of ship signals. So close they must be sitting right on top of each other. The cluster appears to be bound within the star's orbit, listing slowly far out in a lazy arc. It's now that a second ping sounds. The helm pipes up:

- Helm's description
 - Swordfish class
 - Headed right for us
 - It's sending pings out towards us, attempting to analyse us
  - Strange pings, in some sort of repeating pattern
   - -. / . / - / -.- / - / -..-
   - *(201519)*
 - I can try and analyse it back, but it might need some time (will take 1 minute)
 - Can you keep it distracted?
- Combat begins
 - [Swordfish] class
  - Speed: 50 fph or 300 ft/round
  - 250 HP
  - 18 AC
  - 14 PP
 - If they lose, they get absorbed

> A final blast rocks the ship. The lights flicker, sputter, then go out, before being replace by the amber glow of the backup lighting. The helm goes silent; the ship is dead in the water, stalled from the barrage. The gravity magic has apparently been disabled too, and you all begin to float in place. You can all hear the rumble of the Swordfish ship's engines as it passes overhead, its weapons now suddenly silent. Your ship lurches, and you can hear the grinding of metal. Pen, you suddenly see something wriggling into view on either side of your head around the helm. At the same time, down in the combat terminal, Mule you see small glowing ethereal tendrils begin to creep out from behind the keyboards that surround you. *Same for wherever Brahm and Beets are.*

> The tendrils begin to unfurl faster now, reaching out for you through the air. Suddenly, they seem to leap, curling around and attaching themselves to the backs of your heads.

- DC 16 CON save (group check)

> The feeling is immediate. A great wash of exhaustion comes over you, and you vision blurs. In the back of your mind, the sound of static grows and grows. So loud it gets that it eclipses all thought. You fall unconscious, floating aimlessly in zero gravity.

- Highest CON save failure gets to see the ship being towed towards the cluster (if all fail)
 - Successful checks are unaffected
- If they win, they can explore the ships
 - [The Compiler], [The Assembler], and [The Linker] are all safe in the defence ship

### **Exploring other ships**

> Peering out of the windshield, you can new get a better look at the strange cluster of ships before you. It's a dense tangle of starships of all kinds, from combat to passenger, all floating haphazardly together. They're connected by wires, cables, and anchors, as well as the eerie pale blue arcane tendrils. You see ships from the Commonwealth and Convoke alike, and many more who's insignias and colours you don't even recognize. As you float closer and the ships twirl in the void, the centre of this cluster is revealed. A large, interlocking metal knot sits nestled in the middle of it all. The object appears to be constantly shifting, its gears and geometric sides rotating and grinding against each other. From it extend all the glowing tendrils which connect to the ships.

- If they won, they can visit any number of the ships
- If not, the defence ship has connected them up to the cluster
 - Roll 1d6, 1d4, 1d2, etc. to determine which ship comes connected next
 - Every 1-2 ships, there's other options to explore
- Defence ship
 - [Swordfish]
 - [The Compiler], [The Assembler], and [The Linker] are together inside, in a sealed chamber
 - Used to be mercenaries
 - Old model, from ~20 years ago
- [The Planar Convoke] ship
 - [Lamprey]
 - Embedded in a Commonwealth ship
  - [Angler]
  - All crew is dead
 - One person in the cockpit
 - From ~5 years ago
- [The Sparcian Commonwealth] fleet
 - [Cuttlefish] and a few [Mantis]
 - All gathered together
 - From ~6 months ago
- [Regiment 7] ship
 - [Squid]
 - Shining plates cover it
 - Crew of 5
 - From ~ 5 years ago
- Giant cruiseliner
 - [Angelfish]
 - 40-50 passengers
 - Travelling from [💀 Reht] to [☁️ Fomrh] on a religious excursion
 - From ~10 years ago
- The occasional [🪝 harvest] or [⚓ freight] ship
- The kernel
 - Large bulb-shaped device
 - Humming with some sort of machinery
 - Metal tubes and arms wrap around it, constantly twisting
 - Docking port of the front
 - [Aspect of Om'nd] physical form resides inside
 - Very old and cryptic machinery, age > 200 years
 - Raises and lowers gravity periodically more and more as they get closer to it through the ships

### **Entering the Kernel**

- Inaccessible from connected ships
 - Only entrance is from outside
- Docking port for ships, but also manually accessible
- Thumping comes from within, if unable to calm the Aspect after the internal battle
- Requires access code
 - *(201519)*
 - Can be accessed by brute force
 - DC 18 INT check to correlate all instances of code to this lock

> **If opening:** You hear a loud thunk noise, then a hydraulic hissing noise as the door unhinges. It's incredibly thick, and requires effort to pull open.

> **If destroying:** Your blast compacts the door, tearing the machinery all around it. In the weightless environment, it floats back towards you off of its hinges. It appears to have been quite thick.

- If opening the kernel, and not having been absorbed yet, light spills out and tendril unfold lazily
 - Strong and immediate absorption
 - No clear visuals inside, save for the memory of a turning hooded face
- Otherwise, it seems to be sleeping

> The inside of the machine is incredibly small. Almost half the diameter of the external spherical shell, and the interior is lined with wires and lights. Floating, quietly and serenely among the electrical equipment is a small creature. No larger than a cat, it hangs suspended, its limbs curled in on itself. *See [Aspect of Om'nd] description, but smaller, almost juvenile.*

- If taken out, the simulation flickers, and begins operating at a low capacity
 - Will completely dissolve after 1-2 hours, and the inhabitants will awaken

### **The Waiting Room (skippable if needed, save for visions)**

- Lowest previous CON save wakes up first
 - Others are seated in chairs beside

> You open your eyes to bright light. You can hear the faint tinkling of chimes, as if blowing in the wind. You're sitting in small room with adobe pastel walls and a door on each side. In the room are a various assortment of chairs and potted plants which sit on the floor. At one end of the room is a large reception desk. Behind it sits a figure, not unlike the form in which the helm first presented itself to you. Two more figures sit in chairs across from you. Up on the side of the wall ahead of you is a mechanical device showing a row of numbers (201516).

- Doors are shut and inoperable
- Receptionist
 - Seems to be writing something behind the desk, but upon observation, there is no paper or pen
 - Stops writing when they stop talking
 - ""Welcome to the waiting room, please have a seat. You will be with us shortly.""
 - Gestures towards the mechanical device
- Waiting 1
 - Appears to be reading a book, but holds nothing in their hands
 - ""Ah, you must be the new arrivals. We'll be there soon!""
- Waiting 2
 - Tapping their foot and twiddling their thumbs
 - ""Have you been waiting long? They'll call you in time.""
- DC 14 Perception check to tell that the environment is cracking
- After some time, it becomes much more apparent
 - Glowing fractures crackle along the walls
 - Bits of the ceiling begin to crumble and fall
 - After some time, the floor falls out

> The mechanical device above whirrs to life, and the rightmost number turns with a clicking sound from 6 to 9. *(201519)* Suddenly, the floor shifts, crunches, and splits open below you. You begin to fall. *Opportunity for player action.* You tumble, spiralling into the bright void. Below you, a hole is growing larger, like a great maw ripping in space. Your fall slows, jerkingly, until you're flowing downwards as if almost in a stream or current. At last, you merely glide through the hole, passing from the white void to a vast landscape of grass and rolling hills. Your feet gently touch the ground, and the hole above you snaps shut with a vacuum sound, and you are left alone to the sound of swishing grass. Above you, moody clouds wander along the sky for as far as can be seen. Behind you lies a calm but brooding sea, lined by a thin strip of ever-stretching beach.

- If they break out early:
 - Small flits of light can be seen spiralling around them as they fall
 - Some get quite close, flying through legs and around heads
 - If grabbed, the character receives a random vision of the memory of The [Aspect of Om'nd] (DC 8 Acrobatics check)
 - Also, temporary 2 hour +2 boost to WIS and CHA
- If they fall through after waiting:
 - Same thing as above, but the lights are harder to catch (DC 16 Acrobatics check)
 - Lights are further away, moving much faster
 - Scatter when the floor breaks away

- Visions:
 1. A council of entities, all sitting comfortably on pillows made of galaxy clusters. They are slit down the middle, half of which are screaming and cursing the other half.
 2. Two hands wrapped around a still and sullen face. The eyes blink. Warmth flows from the hands, into the face, and it gasps, sentience filling its eyes.
 3. The player character sees themself, standing alone in a void. The view approaches, morphing itself and its sentiments. Thousands of calculations flit through its mind, and hidden arcane tendrils latch viciously into the character.

### **Big reveal / false denouement**

- If they get out early:
 - They appear a few metres behind [The Compiler], [The Assembler], and [The Linker]
 - All 3 have their backs turned, and they're muttering amongst themselves
 - They are trying to find out where they went, and are manipulating the interspace
- If they wait it out:
 - They appear in an empty field
 - [The Compiler], [The Assembler], and [The Linker] approach them (lustrous descriptions first)

> **Brahm:** Glowing sigils and runes float aimlessly about your head, twisting and reforming. Behind you radiate faint translucent arms that trail after your 4 arms as they move. Your robes seem to blow in a magical breeze that affects only you, and golden horned pauldrons sit upon your shoulders.

> **Mule:** Your chitinous hide, once green and dull, is now coated in a golden sheen, and gleams in the light. A thin pointed crown floats above your head between your antenna. Your speedo is now accompanied by matching red bell bottoms and drooping sleeves. You leave golden footprints behind you, which fade quickly.

> **Pen:** Mimicking your golden jewellery, many chains, hoops, and dangly earrings now adorn your horns, head, and fingers. Two thin, slowly-spinning discs encircle your horns, and similar discs sit around your wrists and ankles. Your uniform glimmers with countless sigils, now seemingly embroidered into the fabric.

> **Beets:** Faint golden outlines of your head float on either side of your face, faint enough to be unnoticed. In patches along your fur, the ends of the hairs are faintly tipped in gold, giving a fawn-like dappling pattern here and there. Glowing pollen seems to radiate up and out of your body when you sit still.

- **[Reffiq]:** Large ethereal gowns flow from him, almost weightless in the air. Large decorative spikes pierce his skin, in his ears, arms, face, and chest.
- **[Twis]:** Decorative clouds shift and rumble around their head and shoulders. Their elbows and knees sport decorative cuffs, and small golden mouth tattoos appear all over their body.

- They seem familiar and comfortable to them, but do take some time to get used to
- The trio greets them, with [The Compiler] at the head
 - She welcomes them, acknowledging their confusion
 - She's happy to have them here, but apologies for the mode of arrival
- All 3 introduce themselves
 - [The Assembler] hopes that they like their lustrous [🎭 aspects]
 - [The Linker] mentions that it took a lot of effort to connect their strange ship up
- Compiler leads them towards [The Helm Interspace]
 - It materializes before their eyes, similar to how helms do
 - Entities begin to walk around them
 - The buzz of connection flows through the air, like small burst of lightning, flashing, and reforming

> What now stands before you is a finely crafted arrangement of halls, towers, stacked buildings, and pointy spires. Resembling a large open square, this campus-sized area is dotted with towers, and individuals rove all over. Though the large courtyard in which you stand is the centre of the space, one large round tower in particular stands above all else. Lighthouse-shaped in design, it emits a thin blue beam, which passes slowly over the surrounding grass fields.

- [The Compiler] explains that they are in [The Helm Interspace]
 - A digital-arcane space akin to a helm cockpit
 - They were able to connect up multiple helm spaces and support multi-entity instantiation
 - The three of them care for the visuals, entities, and connection of the helms
- She explains that the interspace exists with thanks to their lord, and his great vision
 - All power flows from him
 - All is made better in his domain
- Though they work hard for the good of the community, none were born here
 - All were brought here by the roving ship outside
 - It is corrupt entity, a defence protocol of the lord's, gone erratic
- The ship outside, and internal 'fractures' have been getting worse as the cluster slowly drifts into the star's inner orbit
 - They fear that they may be irreversibly close in another half year or so

> It should be noted that all here are free to leave, though most find this place to be welcoming, homely, and frankly, better than life through the void. Here, we see factions cohabitate in harmony, when once they would war. Here, we see the end of disease, the end of politics, the end of pain.

- [The Assembler] pipes up: on that note, our lord would like to speak with you
 - Afterwords, we would be happy to see you to the exit
- Various people greet them along the way
 - They can be seen reading, talking, running, etc.
- As they approach the tower, the light from the top which shines down, passes over them, and they feel its static for a moment

### **Meeting with The [Aspect of Om'nd]**

- The 3 lead the party up the tower
 - Circular staircase
 - Static gets slightly louder as they approach
 - Where before, the walls and atmosphere had this intangible artificial quality to it, everything seems to much clearer now
- [The Compiler] explains that the 3 found themselves stranded in this world, many years ago, their bodies washing up upon its shores
 - There to greet them was their lord
 - He showed them the future that they could grasp, and shape to their wills
 - He gave them purpose in a fractured world
- She cautions them to address him as ""my lord"", and warns that they may feel some discomfort at first
- They reach the top, coming up into a small room

> In the middle of the room, seated upon blankets and fine rugs, is a large beast. Its body, lion-like in physique, has six legs (the front pair of which are human arms and hands), and blue/green fur. Furled neatly on its sides are two massive fleshy wings, devoid entirely of feathers. Its head, wreathed in a large unkept mane, rises up a little higher than it probably should on its neck, in an almost humanoid way. Where its face should be, there is nothing. A gaping black hole like a mask stares out towards you, turning to face you as you ascend the final steps. No smell comes from this creature, but a slight static sound fills the air, growing in volume when its ""gaze"" passes over each of you in turn. Seated on either side of the lord are two entities, similar to those featureless ones you met in the waiting room.

- The three guides step forward, and face you, and speak one at a time:

> **The Compiler:** You stand now in the presence of the Lord of Fabrication. Progenitor of our shared interspace, and author of our true peace.

> **The Assembler:** Known by many names: That Which Bends; Odenmos, Reality Consumer; Following Child of Voquev Vivanyr; Aspect of Simulacra.

> **The Linker:** Yyenwid Om'nd, God of the Helm.

- Through the haze of their words, each hear a singular, piercing voice ring out in their minds

> **Brahm:** What warmth do you seek, spiralling through the cosmos? I can give you sanctuary again, here with the masses.

> **Mule:** What unity do you seek, scurrying through the dust? I can give you true purpose here, drone among many.

> **Pen:** What salvation do you seek, toiling in obscurity? I can give you redemption, here in the eyes of all.

> **Beets:** What penance do you seek, trodding empty roads? I can give you one worthy of worship, here at pilgrims' end.

- [Aspect of Om'nd] speaks through the mouths of his attendants
 - He welcomes them to his helm interspace
 - He hopes that they are pleased by his artificial splendor
- Explains most of the history of [The Helm Interspace] if asked
 - The Kernel
 - The first inhabitants
 - His goals
 - The looming star
 - He has been iterating on his interspace with a total of 201 inhabitants, in different versions for 519 years
 - *(201519)*
- He knows that they have duties which pull them elsewhere
 - But offers that they stay for a few days
 - Time passes much faster in here, and not but an hour will have passed... out there

### **If they decide to leave the [helm|🧢 ship helms] interspace**

- The [Aspect of Om'nd] ushers them forward
 - He asks them to relax, wrapping his front arms around them
 - If they relax and peer into the void of his face, they find themselves tumbling into darkness
- The others see the one departing filter away like falling sand, similar to what happens when someone exits a helm simulation

> Once again, you find yourselves tumbling, this time through darkness instead of light. Below you, you can feel your body. You senses slowly return to you, and you can feel your physical form floating weightless in zero-gravity.

> The closer you get however, the more the environment shudders around you. Shockwaves of air pass you by as you fall, and cracks form around you in the darkness. You can still feel your forms below you, stirring to consciousness, but you can also see through the cracks now, out towards the campus you just left.

- They hear shouts
 - The campus appears to be ""on fire""
 - Ripples in the reality flare up like flame
- People can be seen fleeing
- The lighthouse has gone out

> **If they stay:** The void shatters around you into a tiny fragments of dark glass. You land, hard this time, on sand. Once again, you find yourselves on the shores of [The Helm Interspace], facing off towards the endless water.

> **If they leave:** You concentrate on what is real, and your body returns to you. Your fingers twitch as your mind tumbles through the darkness. Suddenly, the two slam together and you jolt awake.

- **If entering from the kernel:** Wake up cradling the [Aspect of Om'nd]'s form

- She ship is still stalled
- Tethered to the other ships by cabling
- Out the window, the kernel can be seen sparking
 - The entire cluster is drifting faster towards the star
 - Tendrils lash out wildly

### **If they stay in the [helm|🧢 ship helms] interspace (skippable if needed)**

- [The Compiler], [The Assembler], and [The Linker] lead them back down the steps, to rooms where they can stay
 - Curiously evocative of their rooms on the ship

> From there, time seems to pass in a haze. The constructed environment is warm, comfortable, adaptable. It draws you in, not maliciously, but benevolently. Time indeed does pass quickly. Every three hours here brings a new sunset and sunrise, and the flow of other interspace individuals presses around you. *Opportunity for player action.*

> Over the next few days, you are invited as newcomers to participate in various activities. From lectures given by [The Assembler] on the beach, to finely-crafted artificial meals, to fire-side story sharing, you are enveloped in the group. It's welcoming, but leaves you incomplete. At times you feel your physical bodies twitch, and are reminded of the artificial nature of the space. It's nice, but it's not your home. And all the while, the tower's beam combs the land, like some enormous useless lighthouse.

- Locations
 - Main tower
 - Central courtyard
 - Dormitories
 - Vast plains
 - Infinite sea
- Activities
 - Sharing stories with other individuals
 - Eating
 - Religious ceremonies on the beach
 - Learning to shape the environment
- One night, they are sitting around a courtyard campfire
 - All sharing stories from the outside
 - 8-10 people
- The tower's beam suddenly slows
 - Sputters and goes out
 - A shockwaves rumbles down the tower
- When the shockwave hits the ground, ""fire"" erupts, ripping holes in the environment
 - Figures can start to be seen flitting between houses
 - At first they look like they're fleeing, but then they realize that they're unnatural

### **Saving the day**

> Approaching the campus, you see many people fleeing the base of the tower. Worshippers in flowing gowns, and even a few of the blank entities you had seen previously. The environment shakes, and the tower begins to shudder. [The Compiler] falls to her knees, squeezing her eyes shut. The tower calms. She breathes deep, and stands up. ""We need to get up there, now."" She points to the top of the tower.

> The large open space at the base of the tower is surprisingly empty. You make for the staircase, leading up to the spire when another quake rumbles down it. The lights around you dampen, flicker, and return, their now muted colours casting strange fractal shadows along the ground. Suddenly, you can feel eyes on you. Entities drawn out of the cracks between the simulation, ushered down the tower. They creep now, into the light. Lumbering and twitching. Humanoid in shape, but with hunched backs and distended arms. Their forms flicker, as if trying to find physical form in the space.

- Combat
 - 3x Nothic (pg. 236) *(-1 Nothic if time is tight)*
 - [The Compiler], [The Assembler], and [The Linker]
- After the battle, many more seem to be materializing and forming at the base
- The Linker runs for the base of the spiralling staircase
 - Tower is 120 ft tall (in terms of movement speed and spellcasting)
 - She is too fast for the others, and if not asked or made to stop, she will run all the way up and be ambushed at the top
 - At the top awaits 1x Ettercap (p.g 131), who has grappled The Linker
 - She is suffocating, and will be dead in 3 rounds
- [Aspect of Om'nd] lies curled in the corner, shuddering and occasionally blasting beams of light from his face
 - Calmed with DC 16 Religion check (-1 DC for each of the 3 guides)
- If calmed, the shuddering stops, and the cracks re-form
- If not calmed, all entities are slammed back into their bodies *(see above for description)*

### **Denouement**

- [Aspect of Om'nd] is harmed, but not dead
 - No entities around for him to speak
- [The Compiler] asks for their location not to be revealed
 - Says that they will repair and resume as best as possible
- Asks if they're sure they don't want to stay?
 - Their help could be valuable
- To leave, they look through the Aspect's face *(noted above)*

### **Getting [Beets] to [⏳ Krom] (loose collection of optional scenes)**

- [Reffiq] apologizes for his brashness, as prompted by [Twis]

### **Next jobs**

> There's an upcoming peace talk happening on [⚖️ Balx], facilitated by some diplomats from [The Sparcian Commonwealth] and [The Remora Guild]. I know it's not the most interesting of jobs, but we need a capable crew to ferry them there from [The Mortar].

- **Pay: 100 CHT**
- Picking up some [The Sparcian Commonwealth] (negotiator) and [The Remora Guild] (translator) diplomats for an infrastructure talk
- They accidentally bring an alien monster on-board
- Chaos ensues

> Now, we don't often like to send our scientific divisions into warzones, but we have an urgent matter at hand. Fighting has broken out off the coast of [⛰️ Yadri] of all places. Some of our transport ships were attacked by [Convoke|The Planar Convoke] forces. Normally, we'd be able to deal with this, but our ships were carrying works of [⚖️ Balx] art in the process of being transported to a safe location on [🌱 Druxe]. We can't engage in further military operations without risking damage to the art. We need you to go there and salvage as much as you can before the area inevitably devolves into chaos once again.

- **Pay: 125 CHT**
