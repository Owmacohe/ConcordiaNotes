# ðŸ§¬ proto-races

{ðŸ§‘ races,ðŸ”’ private}

A primitive, missing link between the evolution of [Yyenwid] and mortal beings / [Oleald]. Unbelievably rare, somewhat incorporeal, strangely innocent, and woefully destructive. Unknown to almost all of the public, save for a few devoted [Sainthood] officials and well-respected biologists.

## **Proto-Celestials**
Large masses of spinning wheels, wings, and eyes. While echoes of these features can be found in modern [Celestials], they are particularly accentuated here. Visual contact often leads to aneurysms and other neurological trauma.

## **Proto-Demons**
Tall and winged, with dark fleshy skin and small piercing eyes. Large masses or horns of various sizes crowd their heads. While inherently shy and animalistic, they do possess strong emotional intelligence, and respond in kind to the feeling of those around them.

## **Proto-Florafolk**
Large, interconnected root consciousnesses that are localized between many individuals and proteins. Though barely conscious, they possess pheremone-level control over their local environments and the beings within them. Often misclassified as infections, overgrowths, or birth defects.

## **Proto-Giants**
Ancient, nearly unthinking landscapes, ranging from mountains, to oceans, to forests. Similar to Proto-Primordials in their unseen intellect, but far less opinionated. Often conflated with [godly influence|ðŸ˜‡ gods] or ecological phenomena.

## **Proto-Humanoids**
Extremely tall bipedal figures with elongated arms and legs, and a distinct lack of visage. They are curious, easily distracted, but also extremely vulnerable to physical assault. They contain within their bodies abstract pieces of cultural memory, art, and culture.

## **Proto-Kromacvin**
Extremely varied in form, with unfettered access to all [Kromacvin] evolutionary patterns. However, their inability to control this feature and their animalistic intelligence leaves them extremely dangerous to both themselves and others.

## **Proto-Primordials**
Largely inanimate, paradoxically-appearing structures, concentrated along [Flow|ðŸŒŒ The Flow] leylines. Based upon places of worship and energy, they tend to display traits of unseen intelligence and genuine will upon those that come in contact with them.

## **Proto-Zoofolk**
