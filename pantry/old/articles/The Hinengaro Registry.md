# The Hinengaro Registry

{⛪ religions,The 214th Isotoxal Compact,Yyenwid Modsiw,Taqadum Period,Hīkoi Period}

An unfathomably large archiving religion devoted to ritual practice through the act of preservation and cataloguing. In the name of [Yyenwid Modsiw], the Registrars (as they are known) perform missions of data gathering and organization, ranging from written texts, to spell captures, and even to metaphysical records of frozen time. It is held in popular belief that some of the artefacts under their care predate recorded [🏺 history] and mortal comprehension.

Their [central physical archive|The Central Archive] is located in the [🔴 inner ring], off the coast of [⛰️ Yadri], in an infinitely large n-th dimensional pocket world.
