An old, wisened [Giant|Giants] [Oleald], living near the more materialistic [⭕ outer ring] borders of [⛰️ Yadri]. Rarely seen by others of their kind, but a travel destination for biologists and historians alike.

Yulfrid is the last of a line of menagerie-keeper Giants, and a conglomeration of all of their ancestral consciousnesses. Their generational knowledge and animal-rearing techniques make them a revered figure in many scientific fields.
