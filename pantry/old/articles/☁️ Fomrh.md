## **Plane of:** The Sky
## **Primary lifeforms:** Celestials

A gaseous spherical orb, floating aimlessly in [🌌 The Flow]. While some speculate that the plane does in fact have a solid central core, the theory has never been proven. The Cities, towns, and paths of the world all float in the air, held aloft by strong gusts of hot air. Thousands of temples, shrines, and graves hang in its atmosphere, and a continual reverence hangs about the plane.

*A thin, perpetual ringing sound wafts in from all around. Clouds of all shapes and sizes float above and below, and one can see small clusters of houses and shrines popping up through the vapours. Bridges between them sway in the breeze, and birds can be seen circling overhead.*
