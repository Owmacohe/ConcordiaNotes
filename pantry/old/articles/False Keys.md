# False Keys

{ðŸ”§ technology}

A paradoxical creation art, stolen from [Yyenwid Ciph] themselves. Supposedly able to open even the most complex of lock mechanisms by simply persuading the lock to open. These fragments of Ciph's will are crafted under great mental and physical exertion, and are thus extremely rare and valuable.

False Keys are known to manifest on a myriad of ways, and most notably, only after their purpose has been fulfilled.
