# Voquev Thimdeit

{ðŸ˜‡ gods,Voquev,Claster Kromaeg}

## **God of:** The present

## **Godly description**
A constantly shifting, and unbelievably spontaneous being. More of an intelligent manifestation of the fleeting moments of thought and movement than a personal entity themselves. As the chaotic and barely organized lord of current happenings, they help to coerce the flow of time along in their own way. However, their shortcomings are often noted by their sibling, [Voquev Yurahh] long after they have occurred. Curiously, Voquev Thimdeit is quite popular among mortal beings, being one of the more well-known of the [Following Gods|Voquev]. They have been known to try to establish contact with their supporters, worshipers, and believers on a regular basis, but often find them centuries-long dead, having been forgotten about in the neverending to-do list of the god of The Present.

Worshippers of Voquev Thimdeit join congregations either by force, or based on religious epiphany. Their godly children are multitudinous, each representing various stages of formation, deliberation, and conclusion of thought. Though they are often mistaken for the children of [Voquev Yurahh] and [Voquev Opeqte]. This is perhaps correct, though difficult to prove.

## **Physical description**
Though rarely appearing in mythos, history, or any relevant discussion, they are known to manifest themselves quite compulsively at events of great importance. In such times, they often apparate in immutable and unchanging forms. Solid cubes of pure diamond, hairless and eyeless humanoids, and manifestations of pure idea are favourites.
