A relatively tame [plane|🌍 planes], compared to its siblings. As the home of [Humanoids], it is full to the brink with streets, hamlets, villages, and dense cities. The spherical world is nearly entirely covered with living development, save for a few patches here and there. Its vertical cities and endless hamlets are well known throughout [🌐 The Pantry].
