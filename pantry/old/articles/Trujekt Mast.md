# Trujekt Mast

{Yyenwid Truge,🔒 private,⛪ religions,Hīkoi Period,👥 cultures}

A fervently-religious, desperately decentralized credo of warrior monks solely devoted to [Yyenwid Truge], the god of war. Though peaceful and reserved at first sight and meeting, they follow their own internal laws of violence to an extreme extent. Their belief in conflict as the sole purpose and salvation of existence has lead them to form their defining dogma: They will engage in vicious and instantaneous combat with any whom they have previously seen with their own eyes, save members of their own order.

Many who encounter them choose to cover their faces, eyes, and distinguishing clothing in the hope that they are not recognized in the future. This being said, the Trujekt Mast survives solely on donations for food, and as beggar monks they are always provided for, however reluctantly.

Occasionally, members will invite those that they have seen (for the first time) to share a meal with them. After this meal, they are invited to spend time with them, slowly being taught in their ways, and alienated from civil society through meditation and combat.

Trujekt Mast is almost entirely made up of [Zoofolk], [Florafolk], and [Humanoids], and is operates mostly on the [🌍 planes].
