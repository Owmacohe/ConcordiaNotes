VDC, formally known as The Vividh *(pron. Viveed)* Deitos Conglomerate is a privatized branch of [The 214th Isotoxal Compact]. Working in accordance with the Compact, they provide articles of worship, prayer books, and other religious goods for the many deities and faiths of [🌐 The Pantry]. Their mandate and frequent government subsidies allow them to sell their wares at affordable and adaptable prices, and thus their businesses are infamously quite busy.
