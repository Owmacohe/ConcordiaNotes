# Yyenwid Om'nd

{😇 gods,Yyenwid,Voquev Vivanyr}

## **God of:** [Helms|🧢 ship helms]

## **Godly description**
Lord and holy source of power for all [🧢 ship helms] in [⚫ The Sparce]. Divisive, off-putting, and inspiring, he spreads himself thin across [🌐 The Pantry]. Though heavily worshipped in The Sparce, his presence is only truly felt in pockets, and certainly not on the [🌍 planes]. The same is true of [Yyenwid Glied].

He is distrusted by many of the other gods, and has been known to abuse and extract those that would serve him. However this is not always the case, which leads to a common conception of the god as a herald of a new age, through which all consciousness will ascend.

## **Physical description**
Donning his distinctive blue colouration he presents himself regally at all times, from reposed sphynxes, to glittering arcanists, to thin sparks of digital information assembled in holy glyphs.
