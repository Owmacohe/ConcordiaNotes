# The Far Wastes

{⏳ Krom,📍 locations}

The vast, barren, and lifeless stretch of flat salt basins and stretches. Once home to many diverse life forms and vegetation, all life (save for the [Kromacvin]) has died out on [⏳ Krom], leaving these impossibly long stretches of land between the [plane|🌍 planes]'s cities. Though the occasional nomadic individuals are known to live in this desert, no long-term societies have ever taken root.

The primary mode of transportation between the citiesis by low-orbit [🚀 starships] such as [Puffer]s or [Seahorse]s, or by time-accelerated bullet train.
