# The Browbeat

{Hinengaro Heist NPCs,The Browbeat Crucible,UminÃ¦}

A sentient star, situated off the coast of [ğŸŒ± Druxe]. Through her white-hot furnace, she manufactures much of the metal and stone materials used for large-scale architecture, [starship|ğŸš€ starships]-building, and industrial weapons.

For the last 53 years however, her star has been spinning at an alarmingly fast rate, spewing off energy into [âš« The Sparce]. This has resulted in a diminished output and an unagreeable temper.
