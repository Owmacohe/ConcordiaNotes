# 🐟 Sparce wildlife

{⚫ The Sparce,🌌 The Flow,❗ featured articles}

Though vast and seemingly uninhabitable, [⚫ The Sparce] has thousands of indigenous species, most of which are nomadic, and spend their lives migrating along [🌌 The Flow]. Botanists are unsure whether Sparce animals evolved from [planar|🌍 planes] lifeforms, vice versa, or a mix of the two, but many similarities can be struck among wildlife from both domains. Animals native to The Sparce often bear some identifying features:

- Bioluminescence (and/or bioluminescent protrusions)
- [Flow|🌌 The Flow]-breathing gills or lungs
- Telepathic movement & species communication

## **Fish**
The most common animal sight in the Sparce, clustering near to [🚀 starships] as they fly. From small schools of minnows to gigantic whales. All bear distinctive bioluminescent protrusions.

## **Birds**
Rarer than fish, but not entirely uncommon. Most of these species do not possess legs, and instead 'fly' indefinitely through the void their entire lives. The most unrecognizable when compared to their planar cousins.

## **Mammals**
Sticking closest to planar orbits, Sparce mammals are primarily small, herbivorous, filter feeders. Bred for utilitarian purposes, diversity among this genus is heavily lacking, with only a few species dominating the top 80% of their entire population.
