Perhaps the most curious and paradoxical plane of all, Yadri is nearly impossible to visit. The [plane|🌍 planes] exists in a demi-space, super-imposed in patches throughout [🌐 The Pantry]. It is accessible only by its [pestle|🚪 pestles] or by accident. Many strange disappearances are often attributed to someone having ""stepped into Yadri"". The plane itself is a massive cluster of gigantic mountains, spanning seas, rolling valleys, and fathomless chasms. Giants of all race and size roam its lands, and occasionally themselves stumble onto other planes.
