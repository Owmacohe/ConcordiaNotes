***[Date: pc-âˆž|Passage Consideration]***

Dark and silent had been the [shores|The Shore] of time as of late. Almost as silent as the waves, a figure passed by. Moving from one deep and far place to another, this shade soundlessly left its footprints in the sands of seconds, minutes, hours, years, and even eons.

Though swift was its passage, the sand under its path was not left untouched. From the footprints and disturbances of its dragging cloak, the grains of timeâ€™s past and future were swirled and excited. Dusk and minuscule particles that clung to the hooded figure from its travels fell from it as it marched, and mingled with the dark sand.

From the instant that they touched the ground, they sprung forth with breath, growth, and blood. Time was given to flesh, and life was born.

As flesh found form in this age of awakening, the breath of [The Astral Walker] still passed upon shores of both rising waves and shifting crude sands, and life found purpose in following a path it would forever dream to walk. Life, in its first steps, marched onward towards the remnants of a maker with no name. An era before titles could be graciously given, instead were earned; Time, and a great store of it, would pass before any such gift found a bearer.

Minutes may have passed, or millennia. As equally great are they in their capability for change. No matter the span, in this beginning, the shambling remnants of a greater shade tread in the only direction of comprehension; Forward. As they walked with each shuttered step, unbeknownst to them, they left a trace of self behind in the frigid and misted lands of darkness they travelled, unaware of their own imitation of the fleeting figure they pursued.

Their own breath graced the mounds of what would be the first glades, and became the delicate dews that would feed fields of grass to be; Grown from the follicle of skin. Their footpaths would carve canyons, small and dainty in birth, but in blind repetition of retraced steps becoming monstrously grand. With weak frames and tender bodies, skin cracked as they wandered and the ichor that poured fed life to the oceans they passed. Oceans that claimed this fogged land before any, were devoid of life, and became graced anew. These waters instead imitated the lapping of time, and with newfound vigour, licked at new shores. Where life had walked, the waters filled their path to feed the first streams and rivers, taking claim of the shrouded land past where they had pooled for time eternal.

Life walked ever onward, until the fateful day where flesh learned of its first flaw and greatest incapability. As they dreamed and yearned to follow in the unfathomable steps of this great cloaked wanderer, found themselves at journeys end, in the footholds of where it had begun. Flesh, unlike the bestower of mystic life, could not pass through the wake of time and fold of space; Held firm to the material remains of passing footprint and fallen debris.

And so Life sank, exhausted into the shallow pools and young glades which it had in turn borne. Unable to move further, but now forever bonded to an ideal of pursuit, they and their kin settled into their creations and dreamed. They dreamed that the newly founded oases and pinpoints of life would grow tenfold, overwhelming and overshadowing the ever-shifting sands of time. And so they did.

Their children, and their childrensâ€™ children grew and died in an instant, and creation was flung and strewn arc-like across the blind eternities. Footsteps left either by the passage of some primal walker, or the tread of its original pursuers, provided ample resting places for drifting creation to land. Eventually in isolation, in each place where an ancient footstep had fallen, great worlds arose to make pinpricks of light against the breaking of the shores of time. To the first of the Awakened Gods, these growths seemed to rise and fade in matters of seconds, and minutes. Though perhaps it was far longer, as their descendants, who now inhabited these worlds were unrecognizable to them, and offered sacrifice and worship to their ancient ancestors.

Through the instantaneous eons, the far-flung ancestors of those first [Claster] may have forgotten their histories and the settlements of their foreparents, though they never lost their drive and reckless need to follow some nameless goal. Through time this goal would be given many names; survival, progress, religion, love. But in the hearts and minds of all [Descendant Beings|ðŸ§‘ races], their hunger for such an ungraspable ideal would never be sated. So it was, and so it shall be, until the great storms of the ocean of moments overwhelms us all.
