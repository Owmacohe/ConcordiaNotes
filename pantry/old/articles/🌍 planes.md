# 🌍 planes

{⚫ The Sparce,🌐 The Pantry,❗ featured articles}

Though planes in [🌐 The Pantry] exist as separate places, their diversity is great. Each represents a separate aspect of existence, and are home to their respective [😇 gods] and [🧑 races]. Most planes are governed by (mostly) democratically-elected councils of ~4-8 members.

All planes are connected to [The Mortar] by [🚪 pestles], but each in different ways, and by different amounts. The only other way to access them is with [🚀 starships], though this can at times prove quite difficult and even dangerous.

Generally speaking, the 8 major planes are encircled around The Mortar in clusters of two in the following clockwise order: Druxe and Aaliat, Reht and Yeima, Krom and Fomrh, Balx and Yadri. Each pair is a member of one of the [🗺️ provinces].
