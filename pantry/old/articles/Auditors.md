# Auditors

{🤝 organizations,Hīkoi Period}

Auditors are professional, field-operating logisticians often hired by guilds, governments, or wealthy individuals to ensure the smooth and efficient operation of some task. While not strictly arms for hire (focusing mainly on disciplinary legal and financial action), they are bound to no moral code and may operate in any purview they see fit.

With no organizational governing body, services that Auditors can perform range wildly, though the best of their order are intelligent, legislatively-conscious, unpredictable, and yet loyal to a fault.
