# The Art of Stolen Eagur

{ðŸ”§ technology,Voquev Eagur,HÄ«koi Period,ðŸ’€ Reht}

A relatively recent practice originating on [ðŸ’€ Reht] that, through magical and technological means, bestows tools and equipment with sentient properties. The Art is used almost entirely to circumvent many sentient labour laws that were set in place in [pc2,372|Passage Consideration], after the mass liberation of the [Constructs]. It is for this reason that it is presently highly illegal (though some motions in high Reht court for its safe legalization are in the process of being drafted).
