{The Mortar,📍 locations,🔴 inner ring,❗ featured articles}

The centremost part of [The Mortar]. A large floating obsidian asteroid, on the top of which the eight major planar [🚪 pestles] are located. They are guarded by their respective planes' delegates, or are barricaded. Travel from The Fulcrum to the other parts of The Mortar is made easy by its many connecting bridges and shipping lanes, as it is the central axis of the entire [🌐 The Pantry]. All major trade, travel, and conflict passes through it.

Travellers are cautioned not to spend long idling near The Fulcrum, and planar delegates and guards are on strict and frequent shift changes. The rock is said to have a mind of its own, an amalgamation of splintered godly aspects, joined together at the head. The asteroid's usefulness makes the occasional disappearance worth the risk.
