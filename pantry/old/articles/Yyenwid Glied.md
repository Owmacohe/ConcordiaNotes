# Yyenwid Glied

{Yyenwid,ðŸ˜‡ gods,Voquev Zephyriah}

## **God of:** Space travel

## **Godly description**
This cackling furnace-child presides wickedly over all elements of arcane and technological [Sparce|âš« The Sparce] travel. Though mischievous and at times genuinely cruel, they are fond of mortal engineers, physicists, and [Helmsperson]s, often appearing to them in rumbling, arcane dreams.

One of the later born gods in the pantheon, Glied is young, relatively speaking. Thus they are often mocked and pitied by the other [Yyenwid], but revered by the [Voquev] for their enginuity.

## **Physical description**
Though fond of amorphous and bewitching techno-abominable visages, they can often also be seen as a small, many-armed, sooty imp wearing a distinctive head piece.
