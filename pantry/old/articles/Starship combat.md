# Starship combat

{🛑 rules}

In combat, and for any other needed purposes, [🚀 starships] have the following statistics:

- **Hit Points (HP):** Current amount of damage that the ship can take before it's stalled and boardable
- **Armour Class (AC):** Number that another ship's [weapon|🔫 ship weapons] or other attack must roll >= to hit
- **[Movement|Starship movement] speed:** Current speed that a ship can move in its turn. Dependant on [helm|🧢 ship helms], [Helmsperson], and [weight|📏 ship weights]
- **Passive Perception:** The [distance|Fathoms] a ship's navigational and radar capabilities can function
   - 0-10: 15 fathoms
   - 11-13: 30 fathoms
   - 14-17: 50 fathoms
   - 18+: 80 fathoms

*Players' note: Ship combat functions very similar to regular D&D combat, except that crew members can use their actions to move the ship / fire weapons / repair / etc. as well as their own character abilities.*
