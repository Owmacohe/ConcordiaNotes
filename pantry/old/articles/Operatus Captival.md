# Operatus Captival

{Yyenwid Alpsid,⛪ religions,The 214th Isotoxal Compact,Aetivima Period,Hīkoi Period,Ukuvula Period}

An extremely obfuscated and under-documented sect of religious fanatics, devoted to [Yyenwid Alpsid]. Though the group was more well-known during the [Aetivima Period] (and was briefly erradicated during the [Taqadum Period]), it has returned in smalled numbers in the [present day|Hīkoi Period]. Through the employ of art-installations-as-bait, the members of the Captival lure victims to enclosed areas, through which [Alpsid|Yyenwid Alpsid] feeds upon them. The process is mysterious and predatory, which has lead some brave cultural scholars and biologists to question the physiological nature of the religion's god.

Inexplicably, Operatus Captival is a signing member of [The 214th Isotoxal Compact]. This has been so for some time.
