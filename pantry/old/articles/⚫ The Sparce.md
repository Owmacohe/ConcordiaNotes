# ⚫ The Sparce

{🌐 The Pantry}

The (seemingly) empty void between the 9 planes of [🌐 The Pantry]. Home to abyssal monsters, [🪨 Remora] production, and smuggler [🚀 starships]. An impossibly unregulated and uncontrollable space, breached only by planar ex-patriots, criminals, military, and dark secrets. Through it all meanders [🌌 The Flow], the innate and possibly arcane pathways of magic and happenstance.

The Sparce has no air for planar beings to breathe, and this can only be traversed by starship, or with [portable magic air|Flowstones] source. Most starships have air sources on board.

*Players' note: In the event you begin to suffocate in The Sparce, the PHB suffocation rules apply:*

*“A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + it’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). When a creature runs out of breath, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying.”*
