# The Astral Walker

{😇 gods,⚫ The Sparce,⭕ outer ring,🔒 private,The Awakening of the Gods}

An incomprehensible figure, known only in the distant recollections of some [Claster]. The accidental progenitor of all life in [🌐 The Pantry] through its disturbance of primordial [flow|🌌 The Flow] shores. Its presence has never been felt since, and no mortal or lower-order [god|😇 gods] will ever be aware of it.
