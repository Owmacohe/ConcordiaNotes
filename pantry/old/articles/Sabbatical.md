# Sabbatical

{The Planar Convoke}

A mandated event, happening every 5-7 years during a [Convoke|The Planar Convoke] council member's term in which they leave their home [plane|🌍 planes] for 5-12 months to travel, research, and absorb culture. Often seen as a practice inspiring worldliness and compassion, the undertaker is expected to live, work, and travel by their own expense, nearly as a unhomed wanderer.

Many who live under the wing of the Convoke are happy to take such members in under their own roofs for extended periods of time, with no compensation. This generosity is less common in [⚫ The Sparce], but not unheardof.

Though mostly unwelcome in [The Sparcian Commonwealth] territories, some sabbatical members have been known to travel vast distances out into the far reaches of [🌐 The Pantry].
