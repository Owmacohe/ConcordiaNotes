3. You keep feeling like you're stepping in something warm and sticky
4. Whenever you see someone looking away from you, they don't appear to have pupils
5. The skin on your hands seems to stick together whenever you close them
6. ~~The written [Pantry Standard Pace] becomes indecipherable to you, and when you attempt to write anything, it comes out as a twisted and curled script of unknown origin~~
7. You keep smelling an acrid stink, like something is burning or smouldering, and it's coming from one of your companions
8. You think that every mirror or reflective surface you see is dirty, and you've got to stop what you're doing and wipe it down
9. You become convinced that something has crawled into your ear, and it wiggles a bit from time to time
10. You attempt to close, and lock, any door you close behind you
11. Pica
12. You can't stop tapping SOS in morse code (...---...) on hard surfaces
