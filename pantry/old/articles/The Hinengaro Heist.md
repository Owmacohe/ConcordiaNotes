Dearest accomplices,

I hope this private letter finds you well. It has not been long since your employment to me began, but you have already proved yourselves quite handy in a pinch. Your efforts to reappropriate wealth under my direction have not gone unnoticed. I present you now with a chance to solidify our business partnership.

As you may have recently heard, there have been whispers and pan-Pantry news circulations that seem to suggest that Prognost Caradil Yun, a high ranking official of The Hinengaro Registry previously though to be dead, has returned to the public eye. However, my inside sources tell me that the other Keepers of Countenance (the religious officials that run The Hinengaro Registry) are not happy with this turn of events.

I have been informed that Prognost Yun has been imprisoned in depths of the Registry's largest off-plane archive for attempting to bring The Registry's patron god, Yyenwid Modsiw, into physical form through the use of a long-lost illustration technique. For the sake of freedom of information and the new business opportunities this illustration may bring, it has to be liberated.

I'm tasking you with the following:
1. Travel to The Browbeat Crucible, a living star on the far side of the Bhava province, to forge a False Key. With it, you will be able to gain access to the archive.
2. Meet with the workers of an Earth Primordial mining town on Balx, who constructed the archive, and know its passages inside and out. Find out where they might be keeping Prognost Caradil Yun.
3. Convene at the central Hinengaro Registry archive, which floats in orbit in the Inner Ring. Break in, make it through, and get out with the illustration.

The first two goals should be doable in smaller groups, but you will need your full combined strength to make your infiltration on the archive itself. Upon completion of the task, you will each be rewarded to the tune of 6,000 chits. Furthermore, please find enclosed 125 chits for any business expenses that may crop up. I wish you good luck and good health. Regards,

C. A.

*The letter has been stamped with the magically-imbued sigils of Yyenwid Anctu, Yyenwid Hueyo, Yyenwid Ankno, and Yyenwid Ciph. It smells faintly like incense and brimstone.*

*A secondary slip of paper is attached to the main letter. It reads: An Auditor will be accompanying you on your task to ensure that no lapse of professionalism occurs.*
