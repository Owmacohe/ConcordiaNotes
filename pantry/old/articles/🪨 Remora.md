# ðŸª¨ Remora

{ðŸŒŒ The Flow,ðŸ”§ technology}

Natural substance which gathers on the outsides of [ðŸš€ starships] which have spent large amounts of time in [ðŸŒŒ The Flow] currents in [âš« The Sparce]. An opalescent, crystalline formation which hardens in shapes that evoke the subconscious thoughts of nearby sentient entities.

Often harvested for its mind-altering properties, it is harmless in small doses, but can be potentially dangerous when taken in large quantities. It is scraped off hulls of ships, boiled down to remove impurities, then cooled into crystals of various sizes. Most commonly ingested by being eaten, but can also be snorted or injected (to less effect). It is non-addictive, quasi-legal, and very misunderstood.

Regular Remora users develop a glossy, iridescent sheen that covers their fingernails, toenails, and some patches of skin. It is harmless, and slightly scaly to the touch.

Beyond its ingestion purposes, it is also used as a clean (but non-renewable) fuel for starships, repurposed for jewelery, and studied for scientific purposes.
