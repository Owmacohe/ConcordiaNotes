# Krom pestle

### **Form**: Impossibly long ""catwalk"" extending out into space

To some, the voyage along Krom's pestle seems to take mere seconds. To others, hours. The chaotic forces than channel the bridge stretch and pull time as people flow through.

Similarly to its airspace, Krom only allows designated, native, or thoroughly vetted individuals to enter its pestle.
