# Introduction

{}

Welcome to The Pantry, a mystic sci-fi fantasy universe of scattered worlds, fractioned gods, and far stretches of empty space. This ancient expanse between planes and solid ground might seem barren and lawless to those bound to worldly life, but The Sparce is far from desolate. From out of the void rise dark horrors, the magical Flow lines of life, and budding empires. People of the Sparce are hardy, practical folk, who recognize the difficulty of working, living, and thriving in such an environment. The resources, freedom, and most importantly adventure that stems from this infinite darkness between planes draws them all in. On starships large and small, they brave the fathoms, and turn void into home.
