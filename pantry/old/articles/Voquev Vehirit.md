## **God of:** Truth

## **Godly description**
The Intangible Foundation, fickle bender of reality and its interpretation. She keeps far from the lives of Descendant Beings, slowly shifting the weight of Truth from one shoulder to the other. Though communion with them can be reached, it is far from understandable, and has many lasting consequences. She is said to be always listening. Always there. She never stops whispering.

## **Physical description**

- A wall-to-wall, horizon-to-horizon spanning mass of eyes, ears, noses, mouths, and fingertips
- A chameleon-like hooded figure, blending into her surroundings
- A smooth stone pillar, rising to infinity
- A ring of eight hands, curled around each others' wrists
- The sound of tectonic plates
