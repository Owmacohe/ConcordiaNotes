      <p>Here's a Dandân!</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>A little while ago, I heard about the format <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otdgj8fBQxc&t=1325s">Forgetful Fish</a>. It's a 1v1 format that uses a shared deck, shared graveyard, library manipulation, bouncing, and so very many mindgames. It seems like a lot of fun, and very quick too.</p>
      <p>Oh yeah, and each 80 card deck contains 10 copies of Dandân and 8 copies of Memory Lapse.</p>
      <div class="mtgcards dandan dandan dandan dandan dandan dandan dandan dandan dandan dandan"></div>
      <div class="mtgcards memory_lapse memory_lapse memory_lapse memory_lapse memory_lapse memory_lapse memory_lapse memory_lapse"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Forgetful Fish has of course spawned countless variants.<br>Mono red versions, tempo versions, Izzet versions.</p>
      <p>So I thought to myself: How can I make something similar?</p>
      <p>Which card could I build an entire format around? What card is its own engine?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>BEHOLD: Life From The Loam</p>
      <img class="mtgcard life_from_the_loam">
      <p>At times, the great horror of Modern Dredge decks. At its peak, a single copy would cost you $30 USD. Let's make a deck with 8 of them.</p>
      <div class="mtgcards life_from_the_loam life_from_the_loam life_from_the_loam life_from_the_loam life_from_the_loam life_from_the_loam life_from_the_loam life_from_the_loam"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In a 1v1 game there are going to be a lot of cards drawn. That's a lot of Dredging. That's a lot of milling. Very quickly, we'll end up with a library that's been flipped on its head. If that's the case, we don't need to care about life anymore. In fact, we won't even need any Creatures.</p>
      <p>So it's a weird backwards race then? Let's speed up that race.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Oh, and we're only playing with 40 cards.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Here are some more additions. Can you guess why we're adding them? Think about what a 1v1 format with a shared deck and library might entail. There's a reason these are all Instants.</p>

      <p>Here's the rest of our mana base:</p>

      <p>The working title is LoamLoam. I know, it's bad. I want to play it some more to make tweaks and settle on a name. With proxies of course. A single copy of Bazaar Of Baghdad is $2,300 USD.</p>
      <p>Anyway, here's the whole decklist:</p>
