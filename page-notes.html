      <h2>Note 1: <q>Writing the History of the Internet</q></h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The head of the ARPA computer research office Bon Taylor has a problem linking various computers and operating systems</li>
        <li>With some other scientists, he creates IMPs (tinier computers to link the original computers), and around 1967 helps to secure the ARPANET contract with BBN</li>
        <li>Originally, the ARPANET was used for military and graduate study work</li>
        <li>Around 1964 however, the idea for a decentralized network came from the Rand Military Cold War corporation</li>
        <li>Funding for the ARPANET continues coming from the military in a Cold War era, and so the research and funding for decentralized networks is continued</li>
        <li>This leads to more computerization my osmosis in society</li>
        <li>From this rise in computerization, things such as Usenet and Unix systems become popular for open-source computer “hackers”</li>
        <li>In 1969, BBN creates a “Network Working Group” to create protocols and have requests for Internet standards in the form of RFCs (Requests for Comment)</li>
        <li>Many “Netizens” of the Usenet felt excluded from the important ARPANET, and were well aware of the big government’s “iron curtain” separating it from the Usenet</li>
        <li>In 1972, BBN engineer Ray Tomlinson creates the first e-mail service for the Usenet</li>
        <li>Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, radio and electronic users as well as “computer liberationists” come together to create the basis of the Usenet as a democratic and open platform</li>
        <li>The first personal computers are made around this time</li>
        <li>Most of the discussions still focused on technical matters, but smaller communities in the Usenet and groups like “MsgGroup” start becoming popular</li>
        <li>In the mid to late 1970s, the various networks start turning themselves towards capitalism and corporation use. Programming starts to be seen as a paid service instead of the previous open uses of it on the Usenet</li>
        <li>In the early 1980s, many corporations start creating their own networks for private use, but would all combine later into what we call the Internet</li>
        <li>Near the end of the report, we see the rise of corporations such as Microsoft, Intel, and many chatroom services, but also instances of open-source companies and services such as Linux, Apache, and Perl</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Note 2: <q>The Time Canada Wanted Its Own Internet Because It Thought the US Would Mess It Up</q></h2>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>In 1971, the Science Council of Canada publishes a report detailing a possible Trans-Canada Computer Communications Network (TCCN)</li>
        <li>The network was invisioned in such a way that users of the network could be free from possible future constraints of a privately-owned Internet</li>
        <li>The report also detailed how the network could be run, utilising a central control location that would inform and manage various smaller province/territory wide networks</li>
        <li>The idea was far from disliked, and was even supported by the then governing Trudeau Liberal party</li>
        <li>A few concerns about the safety of private information was of course discussed, but this was brushed aside by the fact that at the time the majority of all Canadian data was already privately owned</li>
        <li>By 1973 however, the TCCN dream had all but disappeared, and funding had been trandferred elsewhere</li>
        <li>Even a similar network to ARPANET was proposed (CANUnet), but this also never materialized anything</li>
        <li>Today, we are almost entirely dependant on the US's Internet services, and their recent Net Neutrality issues continue to impact the services we use and the Internet we function within</li>
        <li>Smaller communities and countries continue to propagate the small-scale network dream however with start-up or experimental community networks</li>
      </ol>
