      <h2>Note 1: <q>Writing the History of the Internet</q></h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The head of the ARPA computer research office Bon Taylor has a problem linking various computers and operating systems</li>
        <li>With some other scientists, he creates IMPs (tinier computers to link the original computers), and around 1967 helps to secure the ARPANET contract with BBN</li>
        <li>Originally, the ARPANET was used for military and graduate study work</li>
        <li>Around 1964 however, the idea for a decentralized network came from the Rand Military Cold War corporation</li>
        <li>Funding for the ARPANET continues coming from the military in a Cold War era, and so the research and funding for decentralized networks is continued</li>
        <li>This leads to more computerization my osmosis in society</li>
        <li>From this rise in computerization, things such as Usenet and Unix systems become popular for open-source computer "hackers"</li>
        <li>In 1969, BBN creates a "Network Working Group" to create protocols and have requests for Internet standards in the form of RFCs (Requests for Comment)</li>
        <li>Many "Netizens" of the Usenet felt excluded from the important ARPANET, and were well aware of the big government's "iron curtain" separating it from the Usenet</li>
        <li>In 1972, BBN engineer Ray Tomlinson creates the first e-mail service for the Usenet</li>
        <li>Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, radio and electronic users as well as "computer liberationists" come together to create the basis of the Usenet as a democratic and open platform</li>
        <li>The first personal computers are made around this time</li>
        <li>Most of the discussions still focused on technical matters, but smaller communities in the Usenet and groups like "MsgGroup" start becoming popular</li>
        <li>In the mid to late 1970s, the various networks start turning themselves towards capitalism and corporation use. Programming starts to be seen as a paid service instead of the previous open uses of it on the Usenet</li>
        <li>In the early 1980s, many corporations start creating their own networks for private use, but would all combine later into what we call the Internet</li>
        <li>Near the end of the report, we see the rise of corporations such as Microsoft, Intel, and many chatroom services, but also instances of open-source companies and services such as Linux, Apache, and Perl</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Note 2: <q>The Time Canada Wanted Its Own Internet Because It Thought the US Would Mess It Up</q></h2>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>In 1971, the Science Council of Canada publishes a report detailing a possible Trans-Canada Computer Communications Network (TCCN)</li>
        <li>The network was invisioned in such a way that users of the network could be free from possible future constraints of a privately-owned Internet</li>
        <li>The report also detailed how the network could be run, utilising a central control location that would inform and manage various smaller province/territory wide networks</li>
        <li>The idea was far from disliked, and was even supported by the then governing Trudeau Liberal party</li>
        <li>A few concerns about the safety of private information was of course discussed, but this was brushed aside by the fact that at the time the majority of all Canadian data was already privately owned</li>
        <li>By 1973 however, the TCCN dream had all but disappeared, and funding had been trandferred elsewhere</li>
        <li>Even a similar network to ARPANET was proposed (CANUnet), but this also never materialized anything</li>
        <li>Today, we are almost entirely dependant on the US's Internet services, and their recent Net Neutrality issues continue to impact the services we use and the Internet we function within</li>
        <li>Smaller communities and countries continue to propagate the small-scale network dream however with start-up or experimental community networks</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Note 3: <q>Web Work: A History of Internet Art </q></h2>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Article talks about the history of Internet art, starting in 1995</li>
        <li>The term "net.art" was coined by influential Internet artist Vuc Cosic, when he received an unintentionally scrambled email, whith the only legible word being "net.art"</li>
        <li>From there, Internet artists now known as net.artists began using the term to describe many forms of Internet projects, websites, and procedurally generated computer creations</li>
        <li>This culture was heavily entrenched in leftist politics and counterculture, involving issues of race, gender, and popular culture</li>
        <li>Mailing lists and art forums were booming at this time, buzzing with discussions of social issues and propagating net.art creations</li>
        <li>Some of the biggest websites for the net.art movement included, but were not limited to:
          <a href="https://rhizome.org/">rhizome.org</a>,
          Syndicate,
          <a href="https://nettime.org/">nettime.org</a>,
          Irational,
          <a href="http://404.jodi.org/">404.jodi.org</a>,
          Web Stalker,
          <a href="http://adaweb.walkerart.org/">adaweb.walkerart.org</a>,
          <a href="http://easylife.org/desktop/">easylife.org/desktop</a>,
          <a href="http://www.teleportacia.org/war/">teleportacia.org/war</a>,
          <a href="http://potatoland.org/landfill/">potatoland.org/landfill</a> and
          <a href="http://potatoland.org/shredder/">potatoland.org/shredder</a>,
          Heritage Gold,
          and many more</li>
        <li>These forms of art aimed to break free from society, to form new kinds of artistic representation, inform people, and maybe just even be a little bizarre</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Note 4: <q>The New World of Net Art</q></h2>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Articles explores the various forms of digital art starting from its roots, up until just a few years ago. It makes emphasis on blurring the lines in between classic fine arts and the new avant-garde world of Internet art</li>
        <li>The first example that it explores is a performance piece by Ed Fornieles usintg Facebook, and multiple participants. It's artistic qualities come from sets and backdrops created for authenticity in photos that were posted</li>
        <li>The articles goes on to explain more well known examples of Internet art such as _readme.html or jodi.org (also explained in the previous note)</li>
        <li>As it progresses, it shines light on some artists who perheps were new to the style when they first created any Internet art, but were very successful. Examples include John Baldessari's In Still Life or the many works of the website Rhizome's Seven on Seven project</li>
        <li>Internet art doesn't necessarily have to come from the creation of new things however, and the article gives us example of artists who have pushed the boundaries even further by using pre-existing technologies such as existing video footage and even Google Maps to create unique works of art</li>
        <li>Later on, the topic of Internet art sales is brougt up. The idea of the sale of domains and websites both as public and private ownership is an interesting idea. In some examples created pieces are sold for large amaounts of money, but in others, galleries and artists struggle to sell their sites</li>
        <li>As time goes on, we shall see how varied Internet are will diversify, and how already existing creations will grow. The possibilities are limitless</li>
      </ol>
