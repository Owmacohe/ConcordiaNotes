      <h2>Note 1: <q>Writing the History of the Internet</q></h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The head of the ARPA computer research office Bon Taylor has a problem linking various computers and operating systems</li>
        <li>With some other scientists, he creates IMPs (tinier computers to link the original computers), and around 1967 helps to secure the ARPANET contract with BBN</li>
        <li>Originally, the ARPANET was used for military and graduate study work</li>
        <li>Around 1964 however, the idea for a decentralized network came from the Rand Military Cold War corporation</li>
        <li>Funding for the ARPANET continues coming from the military in a Cold War era, and so the research and funding for decentralized networks is continued</li>
        <li>This leads to more computerization my osmosis in society</li>
        <li>From this rise in computerization, things such as Usenet and Unix systems become popular for open-source computer "hackers"</li>
        <li>In 1969, BBN creates a "Network Working Group" to create protocols and have requests for Internet standards in the form of RFCs (Requests for Comment)</li>
        <li>Many "Netizens" of the Usenet felt excluded from the important ARPANET, and were well aware of the big government's "iron curtain" separating it from the Usenet</li>
        <li>In 1972, BBN engineer Ray Tomlinson creates the first e-mail service for the Usenet</li>
        <li>Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, radio and electronic users as well as "computer liberationists" come together to create the basis of the Usenet as a democratic and open platform</li>
        <li>The first personal computers are made around this time</li>
        <li>Most of the discussions still focused on technical matters, but smaller communities in the Usenet and groups like "MsgGroup" start becoming popular</li>
        <li>In the mid to late 1970s, the various networks start turning themselves towards capitalism and corporation use. Programming starts to be seen as a paid service instead of the previous open uses of it on the Usenet</li>
        <li>In the early 1980s, many corporations start creating their own networks for private use, but would all combine later into what we call the Internet</li>
        <li>Near the end of the report, we see the rise of corporations such as Microsoft, Intel, and many chatroom services, but also instances of open-source companies and services such as Linux, Apache, and Perl</li>
      </ol>

      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>In 1971, the Science Council of Canada publishes a report detailing a possible Trans-Canada Computer Communications Network (TCCN)</li>
        <li>The network was invisioned in such a way that users of the network could be free from possible future constraints of a privately-owned Internet</li>
        <li>The report also detailed how the network could be run, utilising a central control location that would inform and manage various smaller province/territory wide networks</li>
        <li>The idea was far from disliked, and was even supported by the then governing Trudeau Liberal party</li>
        <li>A few concerns about the safety of private information was of course discussed, but this was brushed aside by the fact that at the time the majority of all Canadian data was already privately owned</li>
        <li>By 1973 however, the TCCN dream had all but disappeared, and funding had been trandferred elsewhere</li>
        <li>Even a similar network to ARPANET was proposed (CANUnet), but this also never materialized anything</li>
        <li>Today, we are almost entirely dependant on the US's Internet services, and their recent Net Neutrality issues continue to impact the services we use and the Internet we function within</li>
        <li>Smaller communities and countries continue to propagate the small-scale network dream however with start-up or experimental community networks</li>

      <h2>Note 3: <q>Web Work: A History of Internet Art </q></h2>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Article talks about the history of Internet art, starting in 1995</li>
        <li>The term "net.art" was coined by influential Internet artist Vuc Cosic, when he received an unintentionally scrambled email, whith the only legible word being "net.art"</li>
        <li>From there, Internet artists now known as net.artists began using the term to describe many forms of Internet projects, websites, and procedurally generated computer creations</li>
        <li>This culture was heavily entrenched in leftist politics and counterculture, involving issues of race, gender, and popular culture</li>
        <li>Mailing lists and art forums were booming at this time, buzzing with discussions of social issues and propagating net.art creations</li>
        <li>Some of the biggest websites for the net.art movement included, but were not limited to:
          <a href="https://rhizome.org/">rhizome.org</a>,
          Syndicate,
          <a href="https://nettime.org/">nettime.org</a>,
          Irational,
          <a href="http://404.jodi.org/">404.jodi.org</a>,
          Web Stalker,

          Heritage Gold,
          and many more</li>
        <li>These forms of art aimed to break free from society, to form new kinds of artistic representation, inform people, and maybe just even be a little bizarre</li>

      <h2>Note 4: <q>The New World of Net Art</q></h2>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Articles explores the various forms of digital art starting from its roots, up until just a few years ago. It makes emphasis on blurring the lines in between classic fine arts and the new avant-garde world of Internet art</li>
        <li>The first example that it explores is a performance piece by Ed Fornieles usintg Facebook, and multiple participants. It's artistic qualities come from sets and backdrops created for authenticity in photos that were posted</li>
        <li>The articles goes on to explain more well known examples of Internet art such as _readme.html or jodi.org (also explained in the previous note)</li>
        <li>As it progresses, it shines light on some artists who perheps were new to the style when they first created any Internet art, but were very successful. Examples include John Baldessari's In Still Life or the many works of the website Rhizome's Seven on Seven project</li>
        <li>Internet art doesn't necessarily have to come from the creation of new things however, and the article gives us example of artists who have pushed the boundaries even further by using pre-existing technologies such as existing video footage and even Google Maps to create unique works of art</li>
        <li>Later on, the topic of Internet art sales is brougt up. The idea of the sale of domains and websites both as public and private ownership is an interesting idea. In some examples created pieces are sold for large amaounts of money, but in others, galleries and artists struggle to sell their sites</li>
        <li>As time goes on, we shall see how varied Internet are will diversify, and how already existing creations will grow. The possibilities are limitless</li>

      <h2>Note 5: <q>The GNU Manifesto</q></h2>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>The GNU Manifesto is short paper written by Richard Stallman outlining and arguing for his proposed new operating system, GNU</li>
        <li>Stallman saw GNU as an alternative to Unix, the most common OS at the time, but instead of being proprietary, it would be free software</li>
        <li>He hoped to add all the basic functionality that Unix had, such as text-editors, spreadsheets, a programming console, etc. as well as adding new features such as a more crashproof system and more compatibility wth the C and Lisp programming languages</li>
        <li>Stallman believed in free software usage, that is to say software without usage or copyright restrictions. For this very reason, he details why he left the MIT Artificial Intelligence lab</li>
        <li>In his report he was asking for support monetarily, contributorily, and hardware-wize, and was particular how each aspect could be used</li>
        <li>Throughout teh manifesto, he argued that <q>Copying all or parts of a program is as natural to a programmer as breathing...</q>, and was a strong believer that copyright only promoted competition between developers</li>
        <li>He later argued that with a system of free software, developers woul be payed less, but would have chances to make money in many other ways such as personal customization, porting to pre-existing hardware, a Software Tax, etc.</li>
        <li>In all, he hoped to change the way in which we distribute, use, and create programs so that any and all could have total free reign to customize and collaborate within software usage</li>

      <h2>Note 6: <q>Computer Lib / Dream Machines</q></h2>
      <br>
      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Book published in 1974 by Ted Nelson about the people's power to use computers to circumvent the monopolistic and capitalist control of the era's computers</li>
        <li>He argued not only for the technical and revolutionary power of computers, bu also for their design and artistic capabilities</li>
        <li>He believed in an open and free publishing network, a hypertext vision he dubbed Xanadu, and though this idea never really took hold exactly as he imagined it, the internet presented a possible envisioning of it</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Computer Lib:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Nelson believed that "Everybody should understand computers" because there was (and still somewhat is) such a divide between the layman, and that which he likes to call 'computer people'</li>
        <li>He hopes with this book to help demonstrate and bring to light the basic ideas and principles of how computers are supposed to work, and he hopes to do it in a light and friendly manner</li>
        <li>He compares the computer-educated people as part of a 'Computer Priesthood', in which ideas and knowledge is kept tight-knit and proffessionally guarded</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Dream Machines:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>This text is about the design and envisioning possibilities that technology held (and still holds today)</li>
        <li>elson believed that dreams consist of many interlocking parts, and that technological possibilities are no different. He saw that the possibilities of technology could be realized, and has already been</li>
        <li>He realized that the computer wasn't an unlimited tool of tptal creation, but did see its vast potential, and noted that it was achievable with betwemination and knowledge about computers</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>No More Teachers' Dirty Looks:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The opening few paragraphs of this section detail Nelson's complaints of the current education system</li>
        <li>He speaks of how schools tend to squash creativity and free thinking that opposes their rigid method of exact teaching</li>
        <li>He compares the institute of school to that of the work day of an adult, with the simple goal of making it to the end. This of couse stunts creativity and excitement, and punishes those who are not able toa dapt to this normalized view of that society's institutions should be like</li>
        <li>Nelson also disagrees with the use of tests in education, and believes that "an exploitive attitude is fostered" which leads to students seeking solely for results and not understanding. He also argues that subjects are simply ways to keep a tradition of how a subject 'should be taught', and to provide convenience to teachers and administrators</li>
        <li><q>Everything is interesting, until ruined for us. Nothing in the universe is intrinsically uninteresting. Schooling systematically ruins things for us, wiping out these interests; the last thing to be ruined determines your profession</q></li>
        <li>We tend to think of education as a condescending and teacher-ruled activity, whearas in fact, many examples exist in oursociety of microcausms in which learning happens with no teacher. It is by these examples that Nelson argues that computers can by used in school learning environments</li>
        <li>Later in the article, it explores the idea of CAI (computer-assisted instruction). The traditional method of sequencing learning blocks into areas with a conversational element is totally rejected, instead prefering the idea of an open and option-heavy alternative that lends itself toward the student's own initiative for learning order and experiences</li>
        <li>He also boubts CAI's effectiveness and 'scientificly based ideas', saying that while sterile and controlled ideas of what learning should be often fail when presented in real life situations. They don't account for expernal or frankly, human complications</li>
        <li>Some of his proposals for a better working CAI system include the use of "Responding Resourses" which are split into "Facilities" (mathematical and practical programs) and "Hyper-Media" (interactive learning paths with media and design elements). All responding Resources would be unstructured in any way, allowing for student initiative and pursuit, as well as intelligent control over the system</li>
        <li>More possible uses for an optimized CAI could be, as supposed by Nelson: "Hypergrams" (interactive graphics), "Stretchtext" (modifiable text for more or less detail in writing), "Hypermap zips" (Google Maps style interactive world map with info about locations), and many other interactive learning tools</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Fantics:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>In this article he starts by talking about the future, and how there will be a merger between computers and interactive computer systems. In a way he was very correct, and pretty much predicted the Internet in this way</li>
        <li>"When you can’t tear a teeny kidaway from the computer screen, we’ll have gotten there." This is an interesting quote, considering how much we're worried about kids using computers today</li>
        <li>More to come...</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Note 7: <q>The Dads of Tech</q></h2>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Article written about primarily gender bias in the tech sector. Focuses not only on simple examples of discrimination and it history, but also on the false representation of supposed diversity in the industry</li>
        <li>Near the biginning, the article gives many examples in which women pioneered early forms technology and communication. Some example include: Grace Hopper (very large contributor to data processing stil used today), young women who used to be telephone operators and who striked to have better conditions based on gender, the Victorian women who popularised the telephone as a casual communication medium, and so much more</li>
        <li>From from too long ago, the field of Computer Science has begun being engineered (no pun intended) towards a male-centric work force. Instead of the empathetic and 'womanly' telephone operators, we now have antisocial, white, genius-type young men. This makes women, and especially queer women or women of colour have a much harder time</li>
        <li>It later goes on explain the sort of dichotomy of the 'non-sexist' tech sector, for lack of better words. When exploring this, we can see how many male industry workers and executives will often support diversity in that women work on teams and contribute in the industry, but when it comes to office relations, assessments, hiring, and general confidence, the support is heavily lacking</li>

      <h2>Note 8: <q>From Post-Internet Art to Influencer Art</q></h2>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Article talking about the timeline of so called 'influencer art' from its early days in YouTube's infance, to today's Instagram cult-like content creators</li>
        <li>It starts out by showing an example of the film Ingrid Goes West, in which it is revealed that a social media personality and her husband live in a sort of symbiotic, ideal-swapping relationship</li>
        <li>This example provides an example of, as the article puts it, "the creeping emptiness, destructive envy, and deformed incentives that this environment places on all involved"</li>
        <li>In continuing, the article talks about the so called 'fine art - social media continuum' that is used by many personalities. It is an envirronment in which classical fine art ideas and styles are placed alongside social media experiments, contemporary art, and pop culture</li>
        <li>Brand and identity are key here, and often, new presences and artistic representations are brought forth through. pre-established media figures</li>
        <li>This necessity for personality and fame is sometimes harmful, as it allows those already with privilege and connection to be quickly transported to stardom. Conventional good looks and outgoing personalities also play major parts</li>
        <li>The article concludes with an example of how this mass media tool of social media (and by extension, the Internet) can be used to spread false information. In the example, the info is far from dangerous, and the personality in question hides behind a moniker (actually uniqu in these sorts of cases), it does remind us that social media is a very powerful tool if placed in the wrong hands</li>
