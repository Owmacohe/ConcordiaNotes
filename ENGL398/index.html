      <h3>Report 3 : The Active Flâneur</h3>

      <p>In the later hours of the evening, I find myself logging on to find the server quiet. Only 3 of us toil away at 10pm. I like this time. It allows me to do my heedless exploration and documentation at will.</p>

      <div class="flex_row">

      </div>

      <p>The Communitarian 2 group has advanced by leaps and bounds! They have a few farms going, and a lovely base coming along. They even put the picture up that I took of them. So lovely :) <em>The more that I interact with groups, photograph them, and as we'll see later, adventure with them, the more I feel a strange sense of duality. I'm both observer and actor. In stark contrast to Beaudelaire's laissez-faire dandy, I have begun to walk the delicate line between ephemerality and the concrete.</em></p>

      <p>I learned that <strong>Bl4ackbirds</strong> and <strong>bdesormeau</strong> were planning on heading to somewhere called the "demon realm" to indeed "hunt demons". Asking no questions regarding the reasoning behind this goal, I asked to join, and was soon outfitted by armour and weapons well beyond my means. Don't ask, and you shall receive, I suppose.</p>

      <p>Through a series of convoluted teleportation monoliths and the like, we were brought swiftly into a somber yet ominous set of interlocking chambers. <strong>Bl4ckbirds</strong> explained that crafted keys were required to progress further, and would open doors to chambers. I'd soon learn that these chambers held valuable resources (protected of course by legions of  seemingly native skeletons and zombies). <em>I am reminded of course once again of the colonialist bent of this all. However, this time it's different. This "demon realm" is not a native part of Minecraft. It's part of teh Blood Magic mod, and has been veritably invoked into existance through the use of the mod's tools. The colonialism and extractionism being done upon this strange, green place is crafted, scripted even. Did we forgot that about the base game? And what does it mean?</em></p>

      </div>

      <p>The pace was quick as we zipped from room to room. I did my best to snap as many pictures as possible, whilst also firing the occasional misplaced crossbow shot. In all, the experience was quiet, frantic, and entirely claustrophobic. This was made all the more apparent after the event of my death, somewhere deep along the labyrinthine rooms. We were lucky enough to get a chance to retrieve our supplies, but everything felt quite a lot more real for a few minutes. More real than it has been previously, in my documentarian role. <em>I know it's cliché to say, but it felt like a dream. A strange voyage through unknowable pillars, along ambient corridors, with all danger and comfort pressed skin tight. When I "awoke" from this experience, and came back to the overworld, I felt a strange sense of banality to gaze upon the farms, fields, and mountains that had so previously dominated my gameplay experience.</em></p>

        <p class="caption">The only immsion-breaking moment of the entire escapade came from the realization that one of the walls of the realm had failed to load properly.

      </div>

      <p>A new development has arisen. We've just learned that all of the images that we've been placing with the Modern Life cameras are taking up way too much memory, and even crashing the game for other players. Woe! Tragedy and misery! We dismantled the installations (at least the large concentrations of them) as quickly as possible, and now the Flâneur base feels very empty again. <strong>nwatson</strong> was kind enough to give us the run down on how to use the other camera from the Camera Mod, and so that's what I've been trying out now. Though I still need to figure out how to get it into an item frame, but it may work. At the very least, the old F1 + F2 trick will still work just fine. That being said, I do adore the materiality of the Modern Life camera. <strong>Super410</strong> mentioned possibly putting the canvasses back up somewhere isolated, where they won't mess with anyone's memory. A sort or Minecraft time capsule, or perhaps something akin to a buried nuclear waste dump. I think the latter is more apt. <em>I don't think I need to say how fascinating it would be to design a Minecraft abandoned waste dump. We're all familiar with the classic "this is not a place of honour" concepts drawn up by the U.S. military in the attempt to design a graphic and textual deterrant for future societies that might stumble upon half-life graveyards.</em></p>

      </div>

      <p>Due to recent busyness, I haven't had a chance to get on the server in the past couple days. So this morning's job (at least on the outset) was just to poke around with the new camera and document any changes. In actuality, this morning's job was to grieve at the loss of the Modern Life camera, and begin to reconcile with the Camera Mod one. It's a turbulent process, but a very modern one, in all truth. The old is buried by the new, but waits, humming in the dark, for its turn to be displayed once again.</p>

      <h3>Report 2 : Cameras, Souls, and Monuments</h3>

      <div class="flex_row">

        <p class="caption">The small monument devoted the Flâneurs. You wouldn't believe what they gave us, like the roman emperor offering Dionysus goods for the sake of his counsel</p>
      </div>

      <p><em>I began my second session as a Flâneur with purpose, intent, and a fair amount of giddiness. I wanted to make cameras, printers, lots more books, and put them to good use. I knew that for the second official class I wanted to hop around, seeing what groups were doing, and really document the ways that the groups tackled their monuments. Becuase I was so absorbed taking phtos, and journeying between monuments, I found it difficult to actually find time to write, but in any case, here it is. Going forward, I'll be using text styling like this to represent my post-game thoughts, and text styling</em> like this <em>to represent my in-game thoughts. It just makes sense to me that they should be kept separate.</em></p>

      <div class="flex_row">

      <p>Hopping from group to group, I seem to find myself somewhat emotionally distant from other players. It feels weird, like I'm a ghost just floating around. I'll have a better idea sometime soon I think. <em>Though this feeling did creep up from time to time, I found myself very welcoome by those who I did approach. It's all a matter of finding the right angle. Perhaps this is a good example of me ffeeling a lack of social credit (to tie into some readings), or perhaps I'm just being pretentious.</em></p>

      </div>

      <p><em>One of the first things that I heard upon starting my photographic exploration was a remark that <strong>Lunabunn</strong> made about the newly-forming pollution blocks above their base (as can be seen in the last report). Someone had mentioned the pollution mod, and they commented that "there's a bunch of souls above my house but I don’t know what to do with them". Besides the obvious connection to the laissez-faire ideas set forth about Minecraft in Childhood's End, it just got me thinking about visualizing Minecraft death. The soul of the world being burned away. Fellow Flâneur <strong>Super410</strong> has already jumped on death documentation, and has spent time taking photos of the "many skeletons" around the game areas. It's easy to simply count player death and note the pockmarks on the earth, but what happens when death because a landscape feature?</em></p>

      <p><em>Enough fancy talk. I wanted to see what the groups were up to with their monuments. The closest was the 2nd Communitarian group, so I headed directly to them I'll let words and in-game text tell a story for now. Enjoy.</em></p>

      <p>The 2nd Communitarian group was cheerful and jovial, striding purposefully along the land when I found them. We quickly reached the monument they sought. At first, they were cautious to make it across the lava moat, but decided in time to make a small, sturdy bridge. Soon enough, all members were crawling all over. <em>After a few more minutes I asked them how they were doing in their monument-assigned task. They replied simply that think though they were making progress, but they're not exactly sure how.</em> They were a bit hesitant, wondering if it didn't belonged to them. Did it have meaning? Was it their job to upkeep it?</p>

      <p>By the time I had to head out, the team had completed task 2 of many, but the momentum was there. I had faith in them. And I was excited to come back here later and see what future work they had gotten done. <em>In all, it was a really fun day, if a tad hectic. I do think I enjoy the more passive documentation better. Sneaking around, snapping pictures, trying to decipher those "unknowable alien perspectives" and close-to-the-code things that people seem to allegorize in their after-hours creations. I like documenting the aimlessness of it all. And the growing purpose.</em></p>

      <h3>Report 1 : Initial Thoughts</h3>

      <p>I awake, for the second time, in the newly populated server. Now a converted Flâneur, I'm trying to see this place in a different light. Last I was here, I was hectically trying to figure out how I wanted to build my base, what I wanted to construct on a large scale, and how much to borrow from my fellow players. Now I know, I'll be borrowing a lot in my new role. In any case, much has changed in a week. New water wheels, enchanting tables, animal pens, and of course, more pollution. I don't really know much of what I plan to do whilst floating between creations and creators, but I know  I want to document. So here I am, writing. It took me a little while to get the ingredients together for these books and quills, but they're going to be indispensable, I know it. At the end of every exploration session (and probably during), I hope to use these to document long-form reflections. We'll see just how well that goes. Maybe I can begin to parse a meaning from this madness. Maybe I'm just conceited.</p>

      <p>Everyone around here seems to have a lovely hodgepodge of both vanilla and modded items just littering their many XXL-sized chests. It's kinda cute.</p>

      <p>Spawn's changed a lot since I was last here. Big farms and sprawling tunnels for new miners. I wonder how quickly this place will become a ruin?</p>

      <p>My initial attempts to interview denizens have gone unrequited. Perhaps I need to be more persuasive.</p>

      <p>I seem to have found some strange wood-lined blood magic pit. It feels very out of place in this rugged landscape, and the vanilla cobblestone and wood that line its perimeter give the whole thing a patchwork vibe. It's like finding a devotional figure in someone's car.</p>

      <p>I've come across a half-made base in the middle of nowhere. It looks great so far, but has absolutely no roof to speak of. Is it abandoned? Did I just miss someone? Who knows!</p>

      <p>Welp, I just indirectly blew up someone's front door. Kinda. A creeper followed me inside a ring of torches and blew up right as I was leaving. Lovely. People are generously letting me come inside and take whatever I want (though I have yet to take them up on that). I feel bad that this is how I greeted someone in their lovely home. But I suppose it's fortuitous. I should give them a gift as an apology.</p>

      <p>Just got killed by a creeper. Another one. I suppose this is going to be my life for the next while, as I travel between bases and monuments. It's lonely, but incredibly funny.</p>

      <p>I found another large-scale farm. The animal noises are incessant. Calming I suppose, but also kinda off-putting. This one is well lit, and relatively spacious. But still, it feels weird when no one's around.</p>

      <p>As I return to my perch near Luna's base to conclude msy first Flâneur romp, I'm greeted once again by snow. Falling slowly as it always seems to doing this part of the map. I think I'm ready to take on some of the more intimidating parts of the map now, and I feel excited to get as integrated as possible. Time will tell what revelations and allegories come when next I log on.</p>
