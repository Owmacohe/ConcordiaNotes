    <h3>Report 2 : Cameras, Souls, and Monuments</h3>

    </div>

    <p><em>I began my second session as a Flâneur with purpose, intent, and a fair amount of giddiness. I wanted to make cameras, printers, lots more books, and put them to good use. I knew that for the second official class I wanted to hop around, seeing what groups were doing, and really document the ways that the groups tackled their monuments. Becuase I was so absorbed taking phtos, and journeying between monuments, I found it difficult to actually find time to write, but in any case, here it is. Going forward, I'll be using text styling like this to represent my post-game thoughts, and text styling</em> like this <em>to represent my in-game thoughts. It just makes sense to me that they should be kept separate.</em></p>

    <p>Hopping from group to group, I seem to find myself somewhat emotionally distant from other players. It feels weird, like I'm a ghost just floating around. I'll have a better idea sometime soon I think. <em>Though this feeling did creep up from time to time, I found myself very welcoome by those who I did approach. It's all a matter of finding the right angle. Perhaps this is a good example of me ffeeling a lack of social credit (to tie into some readings), or perhaps I'm just being pretentious.</em></p>

    </div>

    <p><em>One of the first things that I heard upon starting my photographic exploration was a remark that <strong>Lunabunn</strong> made about the newly-forming pollution blocks above their base (as can be seen in the last report). Someone had mentioned the pollution mod, and they commented that "there's a bunch of souls above my house but I don’t know what to do with them". Besides the obvious connection to the laissez-faire ideas set forth about Minecraft in Childhood's End, it just got me thinking about visualizing Minecraft death. The soul of the world being burned away. Fellow Flâneur <strong>Super410</strong> has already jumped on death documentation, and has spent time taking photos of the "many skeletons" around the game areas. It's easy to simply count player death and note the pockmarks on the earth, but what happens when death because a landscape feature?</em></p>

    <p><em>Enough fancy talk. I wanted to see what the groups were up to with their monuments. The closest was the 2nd Communitarian group, so I headed directly to them I'll let words and in-game text tell a story for now. Enjoy.</em></p>

    </div>

    <p>The 2nd Communitarian group was cheerful and jovial, striding purposefully along the land when I found them. We quickly reached the monument they sought. At first, they were cautious to make it across the lava moat, but decided in time to make a small, sturdy bridge. Soon enough, all members were crawling all over. <em>After a few more minutes I asked them how they were doing in their monument-assigned task. They replied simply that think though they were making progress, but they're not exactly sure how.</em> They were a bit hesitant, wondering if it didn't belonged to them. Did it have meaning? Was it their job to upkeep it?</p>

    </div>

    <p>By the time I had to head out, the team had completed task 2 of many, but the momentum was there. I had faith in them. And I was excited to come back here later and see what future work they had gotten done. <em>In all, it was a really fun day, if a tad hectic. I do think I enjoy the more passive documentation better. Sneaking around, snapping pictures, trying to decipher those "unknowable alien perspectives" and close-to-the-code things that people seem to allegorize in their after-hours creations. I like documenting the aimlessness of it all. And the growing purpose.</em></p>

    <h3>Report 1 : Initial Thoughts</h3>

    <p>I awake, for the second time, in the newly populated server. Now a converted Flâneur, I'm trying to see this place in a different light. Last I was here, I was hectically trying to figure out how I wanted to build my base, what I wanted to construct on a large scale, and how much to borrow from my fellow players. Now I know, I'll be borrowing a lot in my new role. In any case, much has changed in a week. New water wheels, enchanting tables, animal pens, and of course, more pollution. I don't really know much of what I plan to do whilst floating between creations and creators, but I know  I want to document. So here I am, writing. It took me a little while to get the ingredients together for these books and quills, but they're going to be indispensable, I know it. At the end of every exploration session (and probably during), I hope to use these to document long-form reflections. We'll see just how well that goes. Maybe I can begin to parse a meaning from this madness. Maybe I'm just conceited.</p>

      <p class="caption">Contraptions, waypoints, and smog begin to gather around <strong>Lunabunn</strong>'s base</p>
    </div>

    <p>Everyone around here seems to have a lovely hodgepodge of both vanilla and modded items just littering their many XXL-sized chests. It's kinda cute.</p>

    <p>Spawn's changed a lot since I was last here. Big farms and sprawling tunnels for new miners. I wonder how quickly this place will become a ruin?</p>

      <p class="caption">The brightly-lit world spawn point is quickly turning into a multi-purpose farm, blood magic, and mining area</p>
    </div>

    <p>My initial attempts to interview denizens have gone unrequited. Perhaps I need to be more persuasive.</p>

    <p>I seem to have found some strange wood-lined blood magic pit. It feels very out of place in this rugged landscape, and the vanilla cobblestone and wood that line its perimeter give the whole thing a patchwork vibe. It's like finding a devotional figure in someone's car.</p>

    <p>I've come across a half-made base in the middle of nowhere. It looks great so far, but has absolutely no roof to speak of. Is it abandoned? Did I just miss someone? Who knows!</p>

    <div class="flex_row">

      <p class="caption">The afformentioned roofless house owned apparently by <strong>ssalad</strong>. I like the windows a lot</p>
    </div>

    <p>Welp, I just indirectly blew up someone's front door. Kinda. A creeper followed me inside a ring of torches and blew up right as I was leaving. Lovely. People are generously letting me come inside and take whatever I want (though I have yet to take them up on that). I feel bad that this is how I greeted someone in their lovely home. But I suppose it's fortuitous. I should give them a gift as an apology.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Just got killed by a creeper. Another one. I suppose this is going to be my life for the next while, as I travel between bases and monuments. It's lonely, but incredibly funny.</p>

    <p>My blatant disregard for my own safety when it comes to mobs and fall damage is astounding. But  ahhh, the things we do for content...</p>

      <p class="caption">A boat I saw, frozen under a layer of ice. Would have been very easy to miss if I wasn't looking down. I wonder how long it'll stay here?</p>
    </div>

    <p>I really like how everyone's just toiling away at their own tasks, seemingly completely oblivious to everything else. I wonder how things will start to shape up as groups are solidified.</p>

    <div class="flex_row">

    </div>

    <p>I found another large-scale farm. The animal noises are incessant. Calming I suppose, but also kinda off-putting. This one is well lit, and relatively spacious. But still, it feels weird when no one's around.</p>

    <p>As I return to my perch near Luna's base to conclude msy first Flâneur romp, I'm greeted once again by snow. Falling slowly as it always seems to doing this part of the map. I think I'm ready to take on some of the more intimidating parts of the map now, and I feel excited to get as integrated as possible. Time will tell what revelations and allegories come when next I log on.</p>
