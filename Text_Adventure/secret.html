        assuming that a finite universe is an isolated system, the second law of thermodynamics states that its total entropy is continually increasing. it has been speculated, since the 19th century, that the universe is fated to a heat death in which all the energy ends up as a homogeneous distribution of thermal energy so that no more work can be extracted from any source.

        if the universe can be considered to have generally increasing entropy, then - as roger penrose has pointed out - gravity plays an important role in the increase because gravity causes dispersed matter to accumulate into stars, which collapse eventually into black holes. the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the surface area of the black hole's event horizon. jacob bekenstein and stephen hawking have shown that black holes have the maximum possible entropy of any object of equal size. this makes them likely end points of all entropy-increasing processes, if they are totally effective matter and energy traps. however, the escape of energy from black holes might be possible due to quantum activity (see hawking radiation).

        the role of entropy in cosmology remains a controversial subject since the time of ludwig boltzmann. recent work has cast some doubt on the heat death hypothesis and the applicability of any simple thermodynamic model to the universe in general. although entropy does increase in the model of an expanding universe, the maximum possible entropy rises much more rapidly, moving the universe further from the heat death with time, not closer. this results in an "entropy gap" pushing the system further away from the posited heat death equilibrium. other complicating factors, such as the energy density of the vacuum and macroscopic quantum effects, are difficult to reconcile with thermodynamical models, making any predictions of large-scale thermodynamics extremely difficult.

      <p class="code">
        current theories suggest the entropy gap to have been originally opened up by the early rapid exponential expansion of the universe.
