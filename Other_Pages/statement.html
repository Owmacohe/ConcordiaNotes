          Welcome, weary traveller! It appears that you are about to have the unfortunate pleasure of reading Owen Hellum’s artist statement. My condolences.

          I’m a 19 year old, male, bilingual, self-designated democratic socialist living currently on the unceded Indigenous lands and waters of Tiohtià:ke/Montréal, of which the Kanien’kehá:ka Nation are custodians. Some of the dumb things that I get up to often have to do with (but are not limited to) games & interactive design, 3D modeling, pixel art, web design, Javascript, C#, and photography. My tools of the trade, most self-taught, include the Unity Engine, Aseprite, Atom Editor, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Final Cut Pro, and my Nikon D300.

          In short, I’m a bumbling human being just like you who happens to enjoy making tech and design focused art, and is constantly working on some useless little side project. If I haven’t lulled you softly to sleep yet, you might be interested to know that I recently published the alpha version of my newest game, Arbitrium South. You can check it (and my other interactive works) out at: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://omch.itch.io">omch.itch.io</a>. As if that wasn’t enough for your poor brain to receive, I’d also point you in the direction of my website, where I dabble with and put up nearly anything remotely palatable. Take a gander at: <a href="\">omch.tech</a>. I jangle around like a marionette on the abomination that is Twitter from time to time as well via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/@DignifiedAngst">@DignifiedAngst</a>.
