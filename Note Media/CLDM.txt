Computer Lib / Dream Machines

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction:

Book published in 1974 by Ted Nelson about the people's power to use computers to circumvent the monopolistic and capitalist control of the era's computers

He argued not only for the technical and revolutionary power of computers, bu also for their design and artistic capabilities

He believed in an open and free publishing network, a hypertext vision he dubbed Xanadu, and though this idea never really took hold exactly as he imagined it, the internet presented a possible envisioning of it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Computer Lib:

Nelson believed that "Everybody should understand computers" because there was (and still somewhat is) such a divide between the layman, and that which he likes to call 'computer people'

He hopes with this book to help demonstrate and bring to light the basic ideas and principles of how computers are supposed to work, and he hopes to do it in a light and friendly manner

He compares the computer-educated people as part of a 'Computer Priesthood', in which ideas and knowledge is kept tight-knit and proffessionally guarded

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dream Machines:

This text is about the design and envisioning possibilities that technology held (and still holds today)

Nelson believed that dreams consist of many interlocking parts, and that technological possibilities are no different. He saw that the possibilities of technology could be realized, and has already been

He realized that the computer wasn't an unlimited tool of tptal creation, but did see its vast potential, and noted that it was achievable with betwemination and knowledge about computers

No More Teachers' Dirty Looks:

The opening few paragraphs of this section detail Nelson's complaints of the current education system

He speaks of how schools tend to squash creativity and free thinking that opposes their rigid method of exact teaching

He compares the institute of school to that of the work day of an adult, with the simple goal of making it to the end. This of couse stunts creativity and excitement, and punishes those who are not able toa dapt to this normalized view of that society's institutions should be like

Nelson also disagrees with the use of tests in education, and believes that "an exploitive attitude is fostered" which leads to students seeking solely for results and not understanding. He also argues that subjects are simply ways to keep a tradition of how a subject 'should be taught', and to provide convenience to teachers and administrators

"Everything is interesting, until ruined for us. Nothing in the universe is intrinsically uninteresting. Schooling systematically ruins things for us, wiping out these interests; the last thing to be ruined determines your profession"

We tend to think of education as a condescending and teacher-ruled activity, whearas in fact, many examples exist in oursociety of microcausms in which learning happens with no teacher. It is by these examples that Nelson argues that computers can by used in school learning environments

Later in the article, it explores the idea of CAI (computer-assisted instruction). The traditional method of sequencing learning blocks into areas with a conversational element is totally rejected, instead prefering the idea of an open and option-heavy alternative that lends itself toward the student's own initiative for learning order and experiences

He also boubts CAI's effectiveness and 'scientificly based ideas', saying that while sterile and controlled ideas of what learning should be often fail when presented in real life situations. They don't account for expernal or frankly, human complications

Some of his proposals for a better working CAI system include the use of "Responding Resourses" which are split into "Facilities" (mathematical and practical programs) and "Hyper-Media" (interactive learning paths with media and design elements). All responding Resources would be unstructured in any way, allowing for student initiative and pursuit, as well as intelligent control over the system

More possible uses for an optimized CAI could be, as supposed by Nelson: "Hypergrams" (interactive graphics), "Stretchtext" (modifiable text for more or less detail in writing), "Hypermap zips" (Google Maps style interactive world map with info about locations), and many other interactive learning tools

Fantics:

In this article he starts by talking about the future, and how there will be a merger between computers and interactive computer systems. In a way he was very correct, and pretty much predicted the Internet in this way

"When you can’t tear a teeny kidaway from the computer screen, we’ll have gotten there." This is an interesting quote, considering how much we're worried about kids using computers today
