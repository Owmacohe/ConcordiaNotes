      <h2>Code Quest</h2>
      <br><br>
      <b>Brief description:</b>
      Code Quest is a top-down adventure RPG with programming-related
      puzzles and themes. The player advances through levels, beating bosses
      and improving user stats. Levels get progressively more difDicult as the
      story progresses. There are four levels.
      <br><br>
      <b>Design process:</b>
      In the first days of production my partner and I worked on our project
      plan for the game, hashing out art themes, game mechanics, and general
      details. Secondarily, we worked primarily on game tutorials and
      cutscenes, allowing us to get familiar with the game we were making.
      Once the tutorials were completed, we spent time working on more
      complex elements such as inventory systems, saving player info, and
      working on the initial design of combat. The most challenging element
      in the design process was combat programming. At Dirst we were unable
      to achieve our desired method, but after some consultation with our
      instructor, we were able to develop a way of getting what we wanted.
      The last half of our production primarily involved making new levels
      based on the existing templates we had already created, removing bugs,
      and user testing. In all, the production took about a month and a half.
      Weâ€™re proud with the work we accomplished.
