      <h2>Code Quest</h2>
      <br><br>
      <b>Brief description:</b>
      Code Quest is a top-down adventure RPG with programming-related
      puzzles and themes. The player advances through levels, beating bosses
      and improving user stats. Levels get progressively more difficult as the
      story progresses. There are four levels.
      <br><br>
      <b>Design process:</b>
      In the first days of production my partner and I worked on our project
      plan for the game, hashing out art themes, game mechanics, and general
      details. Secondarily, we worked primarily on game tutorials and
      cutscenes, allowing us to get familiar with the game we were making.
      Once the tutorials were completed, we spent time working on more
      complex elements such as inventory systems, saving player info, and
      working on the initial design of combat. The most challenging element
      in the design process was combat programming. At first we were unable
      to achieve our desired method, but after some consultation with our
      instructor, we were able to develop a way of getting what we wanted.
      The last half of our production primarily involved making new levels
      based on the existing templates we had already created, removing bugs,
      and user testing. In all, the production took about a month and a half.
      We’re proud with the work we accomplished.

      <h2>Waiting Room</h2>
      <br><br>
      <b>Brief description:</b>
      Waiting Room is a simple 3D level exploration environment made in an
      effort to teach myself the basics of the Blender Game Engine. Each level
      is thematically unique, one leading to the next. The player must traverse
      and explore all 5 unique levels to reach the end.
      <br><br>
      <b>Design process:</b>
      Before designing this environment, I spent time following various
      tutorials and guides for the game engine. It was a new tool for me, and I
      therefore wanted to fully understand its capabilities. Later, I spent more
      time planning and organizing the game itself, which included sketches, a
      demo game, and a title screen. With assets and ideas in mind, I set to
      work on modeling objects and scene elements. After these initial stages I
      had implemented my models into the game, added my physics, and
      performed testing. The project took three weeks in total. More time
      would have would have given me more opportunity to develop the game
      further. I do feel Waiting Room to be a good first effort.

      <h2>Bone chandelier</h2>
      <br><br>
      <b>Brief description:</b>
      A chandelier sculpture inspired by the Sedlec ossuary architecture. The
      chandelier is made of 3D-printed deer and human bones, which I modeled,
      and includes a simple wire support column. As part of an assignment to assign
      meaning to abstract objects, the bones became important not only because of
      their structural support, but also the status I game them by their unusual
      implementation here. A reliquary traditionally houses an important bodily
      part of a religious Digure, giving holy nature to it. I attempted to convey
      ‘created significance’ with my piece and its components.
      <br><br>
      <b>Design process:</b>
      I started work on the assignment by creating rough drafts and possible ideas
      to Dit the reliquary-themed requirements. I had originally thought to construct
      a modern reliquary of my own, but logistical difDiculties lead to this Dinal idea
      instead. After a week of modeling and creating test bones, I began the process
      of printing Dinal parts (the bones). A large setback at Dirst was 3D print quality
      of my bones, but after some printer settings changes and remodeling of bones,
      I was successful. In all, I modeled 6 different bone designs, and printed 41
      components. I constructed a wire frame to act as the central core of the
      sculpture, and worked from there. After washing and sanding the bones, I
      began to affix them to the core, and to themselves. This process took a couple
      days, allowing the glue time to set. The project was a new experience for me
      and while it yielded a few setbacks, there was nothing that I wasn’t able to
      overcome. I feel proud of what I made, and I’m glad to have documented my
      process as I completed the piece.
