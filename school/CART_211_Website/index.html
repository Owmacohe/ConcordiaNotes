        <li>The website that you are about to visit is an interactive library of sorts that uses your collaboration to help expand upon and explore the various subcategories of a given topic.</li>
        <li>Starting with the broad and ambiguous aspects of life, it's up to you to select, browse, and add to their various "subcategories".</li>
        <li>Click to select a category, and it will split into some of its possible aspects. Select one of these, and the process continues.</li>
        <li>The first few categories are already populated, but you'll soon find that it's primarily up to you to continue the process.</li>
        <li>Your added categories are saved while you stay on the page, but are lost as soon as you leave, so be careful!</li>
        <li>As you browse, you will be able to access a rudimentary map with which you will be able to return to previously viewed categories.</li>
