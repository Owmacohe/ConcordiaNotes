    <div id="poem">
      <!-- Verse Start -->
      <h2>Late in muddy afternoon</h2>
      <p>
        Sifting purposeless along half-used side streets
        <br>I chanced on a park that I had not intended to visit
      </p>

      <!-- Verse 2 -->
      <h2>As a humid, yet not overbearing sun</h2>
      <p>
        Exposed bare concrete and warmed parked cars
        <br>... I stopped
      </p>

      <!-- Verse 3 -->
      <h2>Being in the habit of finding nearby parks</h2>
      <p>
        The decision was made to ride in, on bike
        <br>To sit, and watch, and write
      </p>

      <!-- Verse 4 -->
      <h2>Now I'm not here to say that Parc Saint-Pierre-Claver</h2>
      <p>
        Is a shining beacon of public space ideals
        <br>But it's pretty. And it's tiny. And it's <i><b>green</b></i>
      </p>

      <!-- Verse 5 -->
      <h2>With a faded industrial backdrop</h2>
      <p>
        Falling leaf-sheaths of yellow
        <br>And a decent waterpark, it's nice
      </p>

      <!-- Verse End -->
      <h2>...</h2>
      <p>
        Really nice :)
        <br>I hope I can get back soon
        <br><br>-Owen Hellum, 2020
